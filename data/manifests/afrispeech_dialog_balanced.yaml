    \ I am looking for my breath, as in, as in I am gasping for my breath, like something\
    \ is choking me, as if I am going to die the next minute and it actually started\
    \ small gradually.\n00:57:99\n\n00:59:01\n[Speaker 1]: Okay. I will be asking\
    \ you few more questions about that. You said shortness of breath started gradually.\
    \ Can you explain on the fatigue, Is there any thing you do that makes it worse?\n\
    01:12:00\n\n01:12:98\n[Speaker 2]: Yes Doctor. The fatigue is just constant. It\
    \ doesn't go at all and it doesn't matter what I do, it will still be there and\
    \ it doesn't even have any time that it use to come. I always feel the same way\
    \ morning, afternoon and night. The thing is just there.\n01:36:02\n\n01:38:99\n\
    [Speaker 1]: Okay, Is there any other symptoms you get, like chest pain, palpitation,\
    \ dizziness, or fainting?\n01:44:00\n\n\n01:45:02\n[Speaker 2]: No, not at all,\
    \ just cough.\n01:53:01\n\n01:54:98\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, When the cough comes,\
    \ How long does it last? Does it come during the day or at night? At what time\
    \ does it normally come?\n02:02:03\n\n02:04:01\n[Speaker 2]: The truth is that\
    \ the cough comes, it comes on its own, but mostly, it used to come at night.\
    \ It used to disturb me well at night.\n02:17:00\n\n02:18:99\n[Speaker 1]: Okay,\
    \ Is there any other thing that makes the shortness of breath worse? Like standing\
    \ up, lying flat, exertion? Do you feel relieved by any of those things?\n02:29:98\n\
    \n02:31:04\n[Speaker 2]: Yes, yes it's worse on exertion and even when I'm lying\
    \ flat. But, but whenever I shift like this and sit down, sit up, I will feel\
    \ better. The thing will no longer be disturbing me that much again. So I think\
    \ its better when I'm sitting up.\n02:55:01\n\n02:56:98\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, on\
    \ a scale of 1-10, Can you describe how bad it is?\n03:01:02\n\n03:02:100\n[Speaker\
    \ 2]: I would say 10 Doc. 10\n03:06:01\n\n03:07:01\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, What do\
    \ you think could be causing this?\n03:09:99\n\n03:12:03\n[Speaker 2]: I don't\
    \ know. I really don't know.\n03:15:02\n\n03:18:01\n[Speaker 1]: Are you worried\
    \ about it?\n03:19:99\n\n\n03:22:04\n[Speaker 2]: I am really scared, I am afraid\
    \ because my father died of stroke. I am scared.\n03:29:02\n\n03:30:99\n[Speaker\
    \ 1]: I am sorry to hear about that. It must have been very difficult.  Is there\
    \ any thing you think I can help you do today?\n03:40:02\n\n03:42:02\n[Speaker\
    \ 2]: Doc, You have so many things to for me because I want to feel better. I\
    \ just want you to tell me that I will be fine and you would do everything in\
    \ your power to make sure that I am fine.\n03:57:100\n\n03:58:99\n[Speaker 1]:\
    \ okay, if I heard you correctly, you said you've been having shortness of breath,\
    \ and you've been feeling fatigued for the past two weeks. Okay, you said when\
    \ it starts, you start gasping for breath, like something is choking you as if\
    \ you are going to die today or tomorrow, and it started gradually. Okay, I have\
    \ few more questions to ask on your symptoms. Any pain or swelling in your legs\
    \ or abdomen? Is there any cough, or like dry cough?\n04:36:100\n\n\n04:39:00\n\
    [Speaker 2]: Yes, my legs are swollen, they are swelling up, even my abdomen,\
    \ they are swelling up too and that cough I told you about that time, its dry\
    \ cough.\n04:58:01\n\n04:59:98\n[Speaker 1]: Do you have any other medical conditions?\n\

    \ That should be 10 years ago and I didn't really manage it very well. It was\
    \ poorly, very poorly controlled.\n05:23:02\n\n05:25:99\n[Speaker 1]: Are you\
    \ allergic to any drugs?\n05:28:01\n\n05:29:02\n[Speaker 2]: No, not one that\
    \ I know of. I am not.\n05:35:98\n\n05:36:100\n[Speaker 1]: You mentioned that\

    \ your gynaecological health seems to be normal. now lets continue with the examination\
    \ of your leg. so based on your on our discussion, i'll like to perform a physical\
    \ examination to better understand what might be causing your symptoms. we'll\
    \ start by examining your leg, your left leg and checking your temperature.\n\n\
    05:35:01\n[Speaker 2]: Okay, Doctor\n\n05:38:00\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, so based on\
    \ your symptoms and examination,it's possible that you have a condition called\
    \ deep vein thrombosis, which is a blood clot in one of the deep veins in your\
    \ leg. This can cause pain, swelling and fever especially if the clot breaks loose\
    \ and travels to your lungs causing a pulmonary embolism. However, we will need\
    \ to confirm this with some tests, such as an ultrasound of your leg, and we will\
    \ also check for any signs of infection, such as cellulitis. In the meantime,\
    \ we are going to prescribe some drugs, some medication to help with the pain\
    \ and the swelling. so, that's what we're gonna do for now.\n\n06:31:98\n[Speaker\
    \ 2]: Okay sir. thank you, doctor,\n\n06:33:96\n[Speaker 1]: okay, so is there\
    \ anything else you'll like to discuss?\n\n06:37:01\n[Speaker 2]: No, Doctor.\
    \ Thank you for your help.\n\n06:39:98\n[Speaker 1]: you are welcome, Kemi. we'll\
    \ get to the bottom of this together and make sure you are feeling better soon.\
    \ take care."

    \ No, my vision is fine.\n01:36:98\n\n01:37:02\n[Speaker 2]: Okay. do you feel\
    \ any sensation in your hands or your feet?\n01:41:100\n\n01:43:02\n[Speaker 1]:\

    02:18:02\n\n02:21:02\n[Speaker 1]: I have not taken any measure to relieve it,\
    \ because initially I felt maybe it's just, it's nothing serious, over time it\
    \ would, you know it would stop but. Oh! Except for like, I tried it for like\
    \ 2 days, where I would drink a lot of water to see if I wouldn't get thirsty\
    \ quick, and it was just like, there was no difference.\n02:42:98\n\n02:43:01\n\
    [Speaker 2]: Okay. So even while you increased your intake of water, you still\
    \ had, you still felt excessively thirsty?\n02:50:01\n\n02:50:02\n[Speaker 1]:\
    \ Yes.\n02:50:99\n\n02:51:97\n[Speaker 2]: Okay. so have you had any previous\

    \ living?\n03:24:99\n\n03:26:02\n[Speaker 1]: I am an accountant, so I'm always\
    \ like behind the computer, so I don't really do much. I'm not really into exercise\
    \ and.\n03:34:98\n\n03:35:97\n[Speaker 2]: So from what you say, is it safe to\
    \ say you spend most of your time sitting down?\n03:41:02\n\n03:41:98\n[Speaker\
    \ 1]: Yes I would say that.\n03:42:97\n\n03:43:00\n[Speaker 2]: Okay. So what's\
    \ your diet like?\n03:44:99\n\n03:47:98\n[Speaker 1]: I don't cook much, so most\
    \ times I eat like fast food or snacks. Yeah that's what I eat most times.\n03:55:98\n\
    \n03:56:02\n[Speaker 2]: Okay, do you smoke?\n03:59:03\n\n03:59:02\n[Speaker 1]:\
    \ No, I do not smoke.\n04:00:97\n\n04:01:01\n[Speaker 2]: Do you take alcohol?\n\
    04:02:01\n\n04:02:99\n[Speaker 1]: Not at all. Okay except, except, except on\
    \ occasions like special occasions, maybe weddings or something like that. Yeah.\n\
    04:10:98\n\n04:11:00\n[Speaker 2]: And during the occasions you take alcohol,\
    \ how much do you consume?\n04:16:02\n\n04:18:00\n[Speaker 1]: Not much, just\
    \ little. A glass or 2.\n04:20:02\n\n04:21:01\n[Speaker 2]: Okay. Are you currently\
    \ on any prescription drugs?\n04:24:98\n\n04:26:02\n[Speaker 1]: No, I'm not on\
    \ any one.\n04:26:98\n\n04:27:00\n[Speaker 2]: And within this 2 weeks that you've\
    \ being experiencing frequent urination, were you on any drug?\n04:33:00\n\n04:33:98\n\
    [Speaker 1]: No.\n04:33:100\n\n04:34:98\n[Speaker 2]: Any Allergy?\n04:35:97\n\
    \n04:36:01\n[Speaker 1]: None that I know about.\n04:37:02\n\n04:38:97\n[Speaker\
    \ 2]: Okay, Thank you very much for your time. The patient, a 45 year old female\
    \ complains of frequent urination and excessive thirst which has lasted for 2\
    \ weeks, and this frequent urination occurs mostly at night. And the patient complains,\
    \ says there is no burning sensation or associated pain during urination. My diagnosis\
    \ is, I suspect the patient has diabetes mellitus specifically type 2 diabetes.\
    \ The symptoms of frequent urination, excessive thirst, fatigue and unintentional\
    \ weight loss are classic signs of diabetes. For further diagnosis, I will request\
    \ a fasting plasma glucose test and a oral glucose tolerance test.\n05:33:98"

  transcript: '00:02:00

    [Speaker 1]: So today''s topic is who or what defines morality. Morality is a
    concept that is constantly debated and questioned with varying perspectives on
    what defines it. Some believe that morality is determined by religious beliefs
    or cultural norms, while others argue that it is based on personal values and
    principles. Ultimately, who or what defines morality? Ultimately, the who or what
    defines morality is a complex and subjective topic, often influenced by a combination
    of factors such as upbringing, societal influences, and personal experiences.
    In this sense, mortality can be, morality can be seen as a fluid and constantly
    evolving concept shaped by individuals and collective perceptions and understandings.
    So, Bayo, what would you say is the biggest influence on your personal sense of
    morality?

    01:13:03


    01:14:99

    [Speaker 2]: Okay, this is quite a tricky question, says that what would you say
    is the biggest influence on your personal sense of morality? Well, one of the
    things that I''ve affected, that have greatly influenced my moral values, that
    would be my upbringing. You see, one of the, as we were growing up, at least up
    to the time I remember, I was living, I was conscious, but I remember my parents,
    they were very strict about what we did, our behaviour to ourselves and to others.
    And they always think about, and they always prioritize one thing, even aside
    our education and our religious activities that we have good, that we had good
    upbringing. Number one, one of the things that they taught us. So when in my early
    stages of life, good moral values were always emphasized such that whenever you
    see an elderly person, you greet the person. If you see, if you see somebody older
    than you, you know how to call him, maybe you call him brother so, so, so. Brother,
    brother Faith. Exactly. Uncle Faith. If he''s much older than you or daddy Faith,
    depending on if he has given birth or daddy and all those simple etiquettes, those
    can, those are things, those are the moral values I was taught while growing up.
    Then it goes to, then we talk about societal influences. Now, when one of the
    things that also the time directly influence my, for us what they call my moral,
    my morality, that would be my social influences. Because while I was in school,
    even if I weren''t taught by my parents, I would see how people were relating
    to other people. My younger people would talk to me. Hey, good afternoon, sir.
    When you see another person greeting the time of day. Good afternoon, ma. Good
    afternoon, madam. If you want to be someone, you don''t know even his name, you
    know how to address the person. And if you, sorry, and if, and when you see somebody,
    even older than you want, you know how to address the person. So, and even if
    I didn''t, like I said, even if I didn''t see all these things around me, I was.
    I went to my place, I was all these things around me. So some of the things that
    influence my moral, my moral values.

    03:40:01


    03:40:98

    [Speaker 1]: So thank you, Bayo but I also like the take something on that. All
    of the things that influenced my moral values is when I was young, when I used
    to grow up, I would be given, I''ll be given something by many of my uncle or
    my auntie or someone I know. So when I''m given that thing, maybe my, my sibling
    will be with me and he will ask some of, some of it for me. Some children that
    were not well brought up, they would respond negatively that they were not going
    to give selfishly in a way that they used to do while we were young, they would
    have clench their shoulder close to their cheek and they will say, son, so that
    thing used to irritate my parents. And when I grow, also began to irritate me.
    But when I was young, my parents always taught me that when I asked or something,
    I will give, I must give, I should give. And even if I don''t want to give, I
    would deny polite, in a polite manner, not show, up in your shoulder because that
    irritated them so much that they had to, they even had to caution some children
    that were not there or even when they, when they saw it. And what we done in my
    life, because of all these things that I''ve been taught, whenever someone asks
    me for something, it''s always on my mind. That it, it is, that I should give
    it. But as someone, the person is asking, I''m releasing it, because I have conditioned
    my heart that once someone asks, you are going to give. And another thing in life
    is that the way that I''ve given people, given people that this person is good,
    that even when I''ve given him, he''s going to give me. And even when I give him,
    even when he gives me, I''m going to give him. So all that mutual and vice versa
    cycle has always continued in my life and it has always helped me in my moral
    values. So over to the next topic, which is.

    05:52:99


    05:52:99

    [Speaker 2]: Wait, let''s not go dancing. Yes, let me, I have something to add.
    So I''ll also ask you something. Now, one of the things also that my parents taught
    me growing up is that we always learn to share. Some other children will just
    look at it that, look at what I have, how can I share out of it. But one thing
    my parents always emphasize was that no matter how little or no matter how big
    it is, you always share. There was certain children in our house and neighbors.
    They had, they had, they had an only child for the child was about five. But five
    years later, they had the second born. The difference was about five years. So
    whenever they think they were born from the younger one, the older one will not
    share. The younger one was share because. And so if the other one wanted something,
    you have to steal from the other one. Maybe they take the thing off his hand.
    So only, you take your share and walk away. This caused a lot of this, problem
    for the, conflicts for the parents. Because they were always reporting issues.
    Hey, mom, this, this did to me. Hey, mom, this did that to me. It gave them a
    lot of problem, and this was because couldn''t the children have to share? My
    parents foresaw this and make sure that no matter, even though I was, I had the
    little savings. No matter how much what I had, I always learned to share. No matter
    how small, what the condition, whatever I had, we shared. Whether it was much,
    whether it was little, whether it was even sufficient, we would share. We would
    just share it. That''s one of the great moral upgrades that my parents gave me,
    which I''m gratefully appreciate it for. So I think we can go to the next topic
    now.

    07:35:98


    07:38:00

    [Speaker 1]: And thank you, Bayo, for your contribution, for your contribution,
    and I would like to cite another example. At my place of work, there used to be,
    there was a, an executive officer that he was. He wasn''t even really into sharing.
    This is not really into sharing, but I mean, that''s moral value and a moral value.
    This executive officer, whenever he sees his, yes, thank you Bayo, his subordinate,
    it would not show the subordinate, expect the subordinate, to give greeting. He
    will greet before the subordinate. Even though the, even though he, some others,
    some people will feel that I''m in a higher position. This person supposed to
    greet me before I greet him, and he will not greet him, and if you don''t greet
    me, I want to make sure you pay for it. But this man, this, this officer wasn''t
    like that. Once he saw you, this, this is my, this is my, my friend, and this
    is my subordinate, he will greet and the person respond to him very politely.
    This also helped the relationship with other people, because there was even a
    time that. There was even a time that this man was sorry, so there was even a
    time that this man was. There was around his personality and his job. So it was
    questioned by the administrative, administrative office and the administrators.
    So when it was questioned, it was, it was, it was, the evidence again was against
    him. But when the peoples, when people heard about this, the subordinates , but
    when they heard about this, they were very confused that this man, this man is
    our friend that greet us well, how could he do such a thing. So the people, the
    officers were not satisfied with their, with their, what they did, what they had,
    they had concluded to do, to fire him or even demote him to a lower level. But
    when the, when I said, I mean, the subordinate were alerted, when they heard of
    this, they pleaded on his behalf for what he had done and they encouraged, they
    convinced, they successfully convinced their administrative on to, on his, his
    punishment, and they, they just gave me a second check, because it was not much
    of an offense, but they gave me a second chance and the man was not. They didn''t
    take that from the.

    10:22:02


    10:27:99

    [Speaker 2]: I also remember one of the, an instance where was, that was. When
    was that? Anyway, I had a story from my friends that there was. No, sorry, pardon
    me, let me give this example. I went to one of my friends house. We both grew,
    we both grew up together, we''ve known each other since high school. So we went
    to, I went to his house and already he has married and given birth. So we went,
    we went together for like a get together party. So I met him there, and everybody
    was discussing, because we were many hey, Lagbaja, we''ve not seen today, how
    is business, how is family, this and that, everybody discussing. In the height
    of all the laughter, everybody was happy relating with one another. That''s when
    we sent for one child to get him what''s the Chivita pack, because he wanted to,
    we just ran out of Chivita. So the girl wasn''t happy that something conflict
    she had with her mom, so as soon as they grumbling, you know, the way these poor
    children behave, everybody was greatly appalled by her behaviour . Everybody turned
    to I said, who just displayed that character? Instantly the man was caught with
    shame, and my friend was caught to shame, and he said it again, in a louder voice.
    go do this and this, and even, she complained even louder to him. This, this,
    what can I say? It caught everybody''s attention even more that wow? What again?
    Then instantly, then instantly. The next time, she said it a third time. And next
    thing, she went up to his feet, took his slipper, and she slapped the slipper
    against his face. Everybody was jaw dropped. I didn''t even myself, I was, I didn''t
    even know when my, literally, when my jaw just dropped. You can imagine what,
    how this girl had embarrassed her father, because her father couldn''t teach her
    moral values. Let me also take you to one of the time when I went to my friends
    home, as I got there, I had heavy load because I had heavy loads. So as I got
    out of my car and I greeted, when they saw me, they couldn''t even greet me, his
    children, they couldn''t greet me. They were looking at me to take, even take
    my bag, they couldn''t. But my friend had to tell them, hey, go and take his bag
    now, go and take his bag. They couldn''t do that. So imagine how this lack of
    moral values have disgraced his father. It''s affecting his family because those
    children will never listen to him respectfully. Who is this one now? Who is this
    one now?

    13:09:02


    13:09:03

    [Speaker 1]: And Bayo, not only this family with this moral, lack of moral values
    affect, it will even affect the children''s family, because they have not been
    taught so why would they teach their children?

    13:20:99


    13:20:99

    [Speaker 2]: Exactly, because it''s what, and it''s because, and it''s what they
    know now that they would treat their children. They can''t just get off the roof
    of their heads and hey, people are supposed to do. That''s what I''m saying, so
    this is what, this is what is affecting moral values. You see how moral value
    is affected. That''s why I''m grateful for my parents teaching that, they talked
    me up and they brought me up very well.

    13:48:02


    13:49:03

    [Speaker 1]: Thank you, Bayo. So can we proceed to the second topic?

    13:51:02


    13:51:02

    [Speaker 2]: Yes.

    13:52:03


    13:53:03

    [Speaker 1]: So Bayo what are some common factors that people use to determine
    what is morally right or wrong?

    14:00:02


    14:01:00

    [Speaker 2]: Okay, now I had a very, I had a friend, she said that she was a very
    religious person. And when I tell you, a very religious person, I mean very religious
    person, it''s not on the scale you think that she''s, when I say religious person,
    I mean someone that is really, really, what can I say? Not biblical, but very
    religious. She believed that nobody could really determine what was right or wrong,
    that only God could do that. You can imagine that if anybody, and if we try to
    determine, to what''s wrong or not, we won''t be coy because we are not, we are
    not, humans are not perfect. I quite agree, but not in that sense. So, so what
    she did was that she, whenever she saw that, she, whenever she thought of anything
    that she would tell her heart that her God, what do you want me to do? Is this
    thing correct? Is this thing right? Is this thing wrong?  Is this thing morally
    correct? and this thing was quite, I must say, it was quite strange to me that
    what is this woman doing? It was a very odd way of going  to determine what is
    right and wrong. Yes. So let me give you another example, another thing, factor
    that people think to use to determine what is morally right and morally wrong.
    Some people, some people believe that society''s accepted standards of behaviour
    often shape people moral compass. What a society accepts this, accept that you
    don''t do this, that you don''t do that, that is what they are. They believe in
    their, that''s what they use there, is their moral compass. This is what our society
    accepts. This is what our culture accept, so this is what one of the things that
    determines what people do. So now what about our personal concept, conscience,
    intuition, people just use the, this thing I''m about to do, it doesn''t feel
    right and if it''s being done to me, I wouldn''t like it. You might be such a
    selfish. I really appreciate that. I wouldn''t like it. It wouldn''t do it. This
    thing I''m about to do, is it really good? And another thing is that a personal
    reflection play a role. You reflect over what you want to do that what I, look
    at the consequences I want to do, Is it a good thing to do? Can I take it from
    someone else? and all these things play a role in guiding individuals to discern
    right from wrong. So then you also look at the. Some people assess the morality
    of an action based on its consequences. So they consider it. This is the concept
    of if I do this thing, this is the consequence if I don''t do it. So they weigh
    their options, which one pays me, which one doesn''t. So they do this to, aiming
    to maximize overall happiness and to minimize suffering. So let''s look at ethical
    principles. Philosophical frameworks such as kantian ethics, virtue ethics and
    social contract theory provide guidelines for determining moral behavior. So some
    of the things, factors that, what can I say, that, common factor that people used
    to determine what is morally right or wrong.

    17:20:01


    17:22:98

    [Speaker 1]: Thank you Bayo and I also like to give some, I also like to answer
    that question. So, some of the factors that also determine what is morally right
    or morally wrong is the legal, is the legal system. Because while laws may not
    always align perfectly with morality, they often reflect sociality, societal values
    and influence on individuals perceptions of right and wrong. So their perceptions
    of right and wrong, so most people think about legal system also part of what
    they used to determine the morality. For example, when you have a case, when you
    have a case with someone, a problem, maybe someone took your land, they said,
    this is where his land stop, this is where yours begins, and this is where mine
    starts. So when we attitude to the court, the court is not, you determine the,
    the outcome. Yes, the outcome of the case because they will use the evidence available
    with them that okay, this is, this is the, for example, this is the survey of
    the land. So if you, I don''t care, you are correct. So that''s how the law uses
    their legal system to, to determine moral values. So, Bayo, do you have anything
    else that you would like to say?

    18:56:04


    18:56:00

    [Speaker 2]: No, I don''t think so.

    18:56:99


    18:57:00

    [Speaker 1]: Okay but I''m just listening. One last thing. So another thing is
    human rights. Because many people base their normal moral judgment on principles
    of equality, justice and the protection of fundamental rights. Because even when
    some people, when people have their own belief,  that okay, these are what I think,
    I believe that is correct morally, when they look at it in the eyes of this human
    activist, would I be correct? Because of this equality will I be correct? Because
    of the rights they claim for this, because of the rights that they claim for this
    person, would they like it? Would they take it from me? So the person would not
    like to align all these beliefs with what that other person''s human rights says.
    So, Bayo, just to conclude, do you have any other thing you''d like to say?

    19:46:98


    19:46:99

    [Speaker 2]: No, I don''t. Thank you.

    19:49:03


    19:49:02

    [Speaker 1]: Thank you Bayo.

    19:51:03


    19:51:00

    [Speaker 2]: It''s a very good conversation.

    19:52:02


    19:52:02

    [Speaker 1]: Thank you for your contribution too. Thank you.

  transcript: "00:00:100\n[Speaker 1]: All right, Victor Murphy, you are welcome to\
    \ today's discussion. We will be talking about a very common practice these days,\
    \ which was not there in the olden days, that came along with the introduction\
    \ of Internet, something called online shopping. Victor, I know it's a very familiar\
    \ word with you, because looking at you is very obvious that you are a new generation\
    \ man. You are a 21st century man.\n00:35:98\n\n00:36:03\n[Speaker 2]: Yes.\n\
    00:36:99\n\n00:36:99\n[Speaker 1]: So, Victor, can you please, a few words, explain\
    \ to me what you understand as online shopping.\n00:47:02\n\n00:48:03\n[Speaker\
    \ 2]: Online shopping is very basic, is a. Is very easy to understand. It's basically\
    \ the purchase of items, goods and how should I say, services too, because services\
    \ are also included online, where you make the payments online and the goods are\
    \ then delivered to you at your home, at the place of your convenience, either\
    \ to your postal office or sometimes a home delivery. But everything, every transaction,\
    \ the bargaining and everything is done online.\n01:20:99\n\n01:21:03\n[Speaker\
    \ 1]: Okay, so Victor, what you're saying is that online shopping is when somebody\
    \ makes purchases online and they deliver the product to them in their place of\
    \ residence.\n01:41:01\n\n01:41:02\n[Speaker 2]: Yes.\n01:41:98\n\n01:41:100\n\
    [Speaker 1]: And sometimes it's not only are about goods, it can equally be services.\n\
    01:48:97\n\n01:48:100\n[Speaker 2]: Yes.\n01:49:01\n\n01:49:98\n[Speaker 1]: Ok,\
    \ that is very nice point, Victor, can I know if you have patronized online shopping\
    \ before?\n02:00:03\n\n02:01:01\n[Speaker 2]: Yes, about a few months back, I\
    \ was in need of a phone.\n02:04:99\n\n02:05:01\n[Speaker 1]: Okay.\n02:05:02\n\
    \n02:05:98\n[Speaker 2]: So I tried physical shopping for the phone, but the phone\
    \ I wanted to buy was not available in my country, and the only way to get the\
    \ phone was through a website, which is very popular, Aliexpress. Okay, so the\
    \ Aliexpress only does is an online shopping platform. So in order to get the\
    \ phone, I had to engage myself in online shopping actively, and then that was\
    \ how I got the phone to my country. So, yes, I can proudly say that I've tried\
    \ online part online shopping in the past and I still do to date.\n02:39:01\n\n\
    02:39:98\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, so what you are saying is that you bought your current\
    \ fine phone that you're using right now online.\n02:48:100\n\n02:49:02\n[Speaker\
    \ 2]: Yes.\n02:49:98\n\n02:49:100\n[Speaker 1]: From an international site called\
    \ Aliexpress.\n02:54:98\n\n02:54:99\n[Speaker 2]: Yes.\n02:55:01\n\n02:55:97\n\
    [Speaker 1]: Okay, Victor, is there any reason why you didn't buy from the local,\
    \ the online shopping, or do you just prefer the one of international?\n03:10:03\n\
    \n03:10:02\n[Speaker 2]: No, that's one advantage online shopping has over physical\
    \ shopping.\n03:16:97\n\n03:16:98\n[Speaker 1]: Okay.\n03:17:00\n\n03:17:02\n\
    [Speaker 2]: Physical shopping is limited to the wares that the owner has.\n03:21:98\n\
    \n03:21:100\n[Speaker 1]: Okay.\n03:22:97\n\n03:23:00\n[Speaker 2]: Online shopping\
    \ gives you a variety, because online shopping opens your world of, like, the\
    \ ability to be able to even purchase, like, different varieties of goods, even\
    \ from the people making the goods themselves. Some of the people making the goods\
    \ can actually, like, allow you to buy directly from them via online shopping.\
    \ But these people that sell physically, they may not have different varieties\
    \ of the goods because obviously they have, they, they work on a profit margin\
    \ where they have to sell exactly what the market needs, their locality needs.\
    \ So if they bring in goods and goods that their locality does not actually need,\
    \ they'll make a loss. They will not sell that product. So they are supplied.\
    \ The amount, the variety of goods they have in their physical stores is limited.\
    \ So that's one advantage of online shopping.\n04:16:01\n\n04:16:02\n[Speaker\
    \ 1]: Okay, so what you're saying is that people who sell in physical store has\
    \ a limited stock, stock amount of goods that they will sell. And online shopping\
    \ also gives you ability to choose from different vendors. Is that what you mean?\n\
    04:34:02\n\n04:34:97\n[Speaker 2]: Yes. Yes.\n04:35:00\n\n04:35:01\n[Speaker 1]:\
    \ Okay. Victor, can I know if you had any problem shopping online before?\n04:40:99\n\
    \n04:42:97\n[Speaker 2]: I'll not say I actually had a problem, but I had phobia\
    \ or fear.\n04:49:00\n\n04:49:02\n[Speaker 1]: Fear? Ok\n04:50:01\n\n\n04:51:01\n\
    [Speaker 2]: Not phobia of trying it out, but phobia that I have tried it out\
    \ because my goods took time to actually come to me.\n05:00:98\n\n05:00:99\n[Speaker\
    \ 1]: Okay.\n05:01:02\n\n05:02:03\n[Speaker 2]: So I had this fear that it might\
    \ get lost or something might, bad might happen to it or it may get delivered\
    \ to a wrong location. But aside that I don't have any problem with online shopping,\
    \ but eventually the good later got delivered. So.\n05:17:02\n\n05:18:03\n[Speaker\
    \ 1]: Got delivered to you?\n05:19:03\n\n05:18:99\n[Speaker 2]: Yes.\n05:19:00\n\
    \n05:19:00\n[Speaker 1]: Can I know if the goods was good or was it spoilt? Because\
    \ I do hear that sometimes people get their goods spoilt on the way while or like\
    \ on the transit, when they are group their goods is still in transit, it gets\
    \ spoilt or lost or something. Was your own like that?\n05:36:02\n\n05:36:98\n\
    [Speaker 2]: Yeah, it was in perfect condition.\n05:37:99\n\n05:38:00\n[Speaker\
    \ 1]: Okay. It was in perfect conditions. So if you're giving a chance again or.\
    \ You will still shop more online or will you still like to shop more online?\n\
    05:50:03\n\n05:50:03\n[Speaker 2]: Obviously. Obviously. Obviously.\n05:51:01\n\
    \n05:51:01\n[Speaker 1]: So what you are saying?\n05:52:00\n\n05:52:00\n[Speaker\
    \ 2]: I like the ease with online shopping. I'll obviously try it again next time.\n\
    05:55:100\n\n05:56:02\nSpeaker 1]: Okay. With the ease, you tend to enjoy shopping\
    \ online more?\n06:00:98\n\n06:00:98\n[Speaker 2]: Yes.\n06:00:99\n\n06:01:99\n\
    [Speaker 1]: How about the price difference? Don't you consider the fact that\
    \ the price of offline market will be cheaper than the price of online marketing?\n\
    06:11:02\n\n06:15:00\n[Speaker 2]: It's subjective, but from my own experience\
    \ is online shopping. Online shopping, most times the pricing is way lower than\
    \ the pricing in the local markets. Most times, most times. Because not all shoppers\
    \ do this. Not all. Sorry, not all market sellers do this, but some of them do\
    \ shop for their goods online.\n06:42:01\n\n06:43:03\n[Speaker 1]: Okay.\n06:42:99\n\
    \n06:42:99\n[Speaker 2]: And when they now shop their goods online, they now sell\
    \ it at a higher price than the actual price. than the actual price. So if you\
    \ can get access to the online vendors that they're buying it from, you can actually\
    \ get it at the real original price without the added fee.\n06:57:01\n\n06:57:02\n\
    [Speaker 1]: Yeah.\n06:57:98\n\n06:57:99\n[Speaker 2]: So most times, shopping\
    \ online can be cheaper than shopping in your local stores. Yes.\n07:04:00\n\n\
    07:05:00\n[Speaker 1]: So what you're saying is that online can be cheaper sometimes\
    \ because you tend to get the goods from the original supplier, not from the retailers?\n\
    07:13:98\n\n07:14:02\n[Speaker 2]: Yes, yes, yes.\n07:15:00\n\n07:15:02\n[Speaker\
    \ 1]: Oh, that's very wonderful, Victor. Victor, can I know if you have any specific\
    \ amount of goods that you can buy online or you can purchase any amount. You\
    \ know, there are people that used to say that, I can't spend less than 10,000\
    \ or less than 100,000 online. Do you think you can purchase a product of up to\
    \ a million naira online?\n07:43:02\n\n07:44:99\n[Speaker 2]: Yes. Many people\
    \ have that fear of purchasing online unless you are dealing with a website. You\
    \ know, online shopping, you don't just. Online shopping is not just one shop.\
    \ There are different, different websites selling stuff online. So they are amongst\
    \ this websites there are trusted website in which they already have a track record\
    \ of delivering goods to their customers, to their customer base. So those kind\
    \ of websites, you are in 100% safe hands because they have measures in which\
    \ that if you ever buy your goods and something bad happens along the way, you\
    \ can always contact them and you can always have a way to get your goods back\
    \ or something like that. So because of that security, spending a lot of money\
    \ online doing online shopping is not actually a big problem because you are in\
    \ safe hands if you go with the right trusted, vendors.\n08:42:00\n\n08:42:01\n\
    [Speaker 1]: Okay. Okay.\n So what you're trying to say is that you are very comfortable\
    \ with shopping online, no matter the amount of money, once it is a reputable\
    \ online market.\n08:56:01\n\n08:56:98\n[Speaker 2]: Yes, online shop. Yes.\n\
    08:58:02\n\n08:58:97\n[Speaker 1]: Okay. Okay. That's a very interesting one,\
    \ Victor. I do hope I join to shop online very soon. Now, if people ask you, do\
    \ you advise them to really shop online or shop offline?\n09:14:98\n\n09:16:98\n\
    [Speaker 2]: Okay, online shopping is actually very enjoyable because, one, you\
    \ don't have to like. You don't have to, you don't have to like. There's so many\
    \ things that are in my mind. So that's why I'm just trying, taking my time to\
    \ actually go through the thought process. You, there's more convenience because\
    \ you can actually sit in your home and just click a button and get your stuff\
    \ ordered to you. You understand? You don't have to actually leave and go to the\
    \ crowded markets where you'll be struggling with other. Struggling with other\
    \ shoppers. And you, you, yes, you get frustrated by the environment of the market.\
    \ You know, how busy markets are now and how frustrating can. And sometimes looking\
    \ for the item you want in a physical shop in a physical market can be quite stressful,\
    \ especially if the market is big and you have to walk from one place to another\
    \ to another. And sometimes, even though you go to the right place, sometimes\
    \ they may not have the goods you want. Online shopping, most of these online\
    \ shopping platforms, they made it very easy for you to find the thing you want.\
    \ All you have to do is just do, just do a little magic with your keyboard, go\
    \ to the search bar, type the thing you are looking for, and then you get a list,\
    \ not just one of the item you want, you get a variety of the item you want and\
    \ you can, at your own convenience, at your bed, even at your bed, choose the\
    \ item you want and then just make your purchase very easy and fast, and then\
    \ get your stuff delivered at the most convenient time.\n11:04:98\n\n11:06:03\n\
    [Speaker 1]: Wow. Wow. That is very interesting, Victor. So what you're saying\
    \ is that with online shopping, you don't have to pass through the hassle of meeting\
    \ a lot of people in the market and those walking around, especially in the very\
    \ large market where you have to trek from one shop to another and make inquiries.\
    \ But with online shopping, you can just click log into the site and just scroll\
    \ and pick whatever thing you want without really meeting the seller. I believe\
    \ you're this type of person that doesn't like all those cat calls that you get\
    \ from the sellers.\n11:42:97\n\n11:42:97\n[Speaker 2]: Yeah, yeah, that's very\
    \ important. Fine boy, come here.\n11:45:98\n\n11:47:01\n[Speaker 1]: Fine girl.\
    \ What do you want?\n11:48:98\n\n11:48:98\n[Speaker 2]: What do you want?\n11:48:100\n\
    \n11:49:100\n[Speaker 1]: I have it. I have it. Even when they don't, they don't\
    \ know what you're looking for, but they're already shouting, fine girl, come,\
    \ come, come. Well, Victor, you have a very solid point. I really agree with you\
    \ that, shopping online is very interesting. Okay, so it's very, very interesting.\
    \ But, I, I do hope that we in Nigeria get a strong shopping online platform because\
    \ I've had a very bad experience where I, I was able to experience this common\
    \ wish that they call, what I ordered versus what I got. Because there was a time\
    \ I got a product and it was a product that has been, tampered with. I felt very\
    \ bad. So that really discouraged me for some time from ordering from that site.\
    \ So, but with your analysis these days, I think I will, I will try again to reconsider\
    \ shopping online.\n12:51:99\n\n12:53:02\n[Speaker 2]: Yeah, you should. You'll\
    \ actually enjoy it.\n12:56:03\n\n12:56:03\nSpeaker 1]: Even though it gives a\
    \ big man vibes. I hope I become a bigger man very soon so I can be able to spend\
    \ millions of Naira\n13:03:03\n\n13:03:03\n[Speaker 2]: You'll get there.\n13:03:00\n\
    \n13:03:97\n[Speaker 1]: Without really leaving the comfort of my zone because\
    \ comfort of my home, because right now, everybody is looking for comfort. Whichever\
    \ way you can give people comfort, they are ready to give you money. So online\
    \ shopping to me is also interesting. According to how you described it, I can\
    \ stay at my home and order. Would you like to tell my audience something else\
    \ before we end the discussion? Victor, I have been enjoying your gist for some\
    \ minutes now. For over 13 minutes. \n13:32:98\n\n13:34:98\n[Speaker 2]: Yeah.\
    \ I just want to point out some disadvantages of online shopping.\n13:38:00\n\n\
    13:38:00\n[Speaker 1]: Okay. Outside the advantages of convenience and cheaper\

    \ enjoyable and convenient and gives you variety of goods to choose from.\n13:50:02\n\
    \n13:49:98\n[Speaker 1]: Okay.\n13:50:00\n\n13:50:97\n[Speaker 2]: One of the\
    \ most like annoying part of online shopping, I'll not say it annoying to some,\
    \ its annoying to some. To some, It's not annoying, but it's a con.\n14:00:99\n\
    \n14:02:02\n[Speaker 1]: Yeah.\n14:01:98\n\n14:03:00\n[Speaker 2]: Its delayed\
    \ delivery.\n14:05:03\n\n14:04:99\n[Speaker 1]: Oh, yes.\n14:06:02\n\n14:06:02\n\
    [Speaker 2]: Like in, unlike physical shores where items can be given to you immediately.\
    \ This one, you have to wait for some time, some time for your stuff to be delayed\
    \ to you. Then another one is weeks of fraud if you fall in the hands of the fraudulent\
    \ vendors.\n14:21:02\n\n14:21:02\n[Speaker 1]: Okay.\n14:21:98\n\n14:22:00\n[Speaker\
    \ 2]: So that's why I always suggest that you should go with reputable stores\
    \ online. You should not just shop with anyone. The fact that you cannot bargain\
    \ price.\n14:30:01\n\n14:30:98\nSpeaker 1]: Yes.\n14:31:01\n\n14:32:02\n[Speaker\
    \ 2]: You can bargain with some vendors. Yes. Like some, some do allow you to\
    \ bargain, but most don't allow you to bargain. Especially the ones that are like\
    \ websites. Yes. One page websites and those kind of ones that the price now already\
    \ be set. You have to only be. The only way to make payments is just slot in your\
    \ credit card and pay.  But some do allow you, especially if some of them are\
    \ vendors that use social media accounts. You can actually bargain and chat with\
    \ them. But most of them that are like big shops, shopping website like Aliexpress,\
    \ Jumia and the rest, you know, the names, they don't allow you to bargain. I\
    \ think that's all. That's all I want.\n15:13:100\n\n15:14:01\n[Speaker 1]: Victor,\
    \ thank you so much for this, your wonderful contribution. I really appreciate\
    \ giving me your busy time tonight. Thank you, Victor.\n15:22:98\n\n15:23:01\n\

    [Speaker 1]: Okay, so today''s topic is the church, state and politics. The relationship
    between the church, the state and politics has been a subject of debate and controversy
    for centuries. The church as an institute upholds significant influence and power
    over the state and political decisions. In many societies. Religion plays a crucial
    role in shaping the political landscape and influencing policies. However, the
    separation of church and state is also found, is also a fundamental principle
    in many countries where the government is not supposed to be under control or
    influence of a particular religion. The discussion around this topic often revolves
    around issues such as the role of religion in government, the extent of religious
    freedoms, and the impact of religious beliefs on political decision making. Ultimately,
    the relationship between the church, state and politics is a complex and ongoing
    dialogue with various perspectives and viewpoints. So one of our questions for
    today is what are our thoughts on the separation of the church and how and state
    and how it impacts politics? And do you believe religion should play a role in
    government decisions? Well, this is quite a handful. Well, I''ll take the lead
    on this. So one of the first four. The religion should not have a part to play
    in politics. I know some. I know you will often ask why? Well, that''s because
    religion is a very powerful thing. Because one of the key things about religion
    is that bad things about religion is that religion doesn''t, doesn''t need to
    be explained. Anything can be in religion. Religion can believe that the earth
    was made from sand and green sand and everybody would take it that way. Because
    that''s what we know. It doesn''t have to make sense. All it''s just needs to
    be. Just to be that. And it''s that. So because of this, religion is so, is bland,
    is so, is, uh, what can I say? Uh, is just there. So I wanted about politics,
    is that politics, one thing gives to the other. Without this, you can''t have
    that. So when you are wanting, when you want to include something on, is like
    an uncertainty with a certainty. If the canton cannot mix together, there will
    be problem. I mostly look at religion. Religion believes that the count they should.
    Each religion believes that there should only be one religion. So because of this,
    this are one of the reasons why religion cannot coexist, cannot play a role in
    government decision. One thing about religion, religion also supports it also
    is that believes that they can only be one religion. Christianity believes that
    it is the only, is the only original one. And every other thing is counterfeit,
    is fit and it''s fake and we leave them to destruction. So because of this, if
    religions start playing a role in political, in government decisions, it will
    cause a bias. When a christian president is unseat, you will be biased towards
    Islam citizens, even though they are of the same nation, you understand it cause
    marginalization and they cause problem in society, in the government. So, so another,
    and there''s another thing. Well, let''s also look at nations who have been, let''s
    take the Iran, Iraq, all these nations for example. They are being ruled by religion
    and is having negative effects on them. Number one, when number one is constitutional,
    what can I say? It''s causes a tighter picture because everything around them
    is Islam, Islam, Islam. And because of that, christians are not what can I say,
    are not motivated to go there. And this affects their economy because even if
    personally, even if there are some artifacts there, some choice attractions there,
    I wouldn''t go there because of their religion. That is a religious state. So
    this is, and this is affecting the economy. So these are one of the reasons why,
    what can I say? Why religion cannot play or should not play a role in government
    decisions.

    04:21:96


    04:24:02

    [Speaker 2]: Let me cut you there. Let me cut you there. I don''t, I certainly
    do not agree with what you are saying. I agree. I certainly do not agree with
    what you have said because honestly I believe religion should have a play, I honestly
    believe, don''t believe that religion should have a plain. Religion should have
    a play in the state and all others. Because when you look at it without religion,
    what are we, we have to draw closer to God. Imagine if we have, we are in a tie
    down now. And we don''t, just like the country is ruled by nothing. We are just,
    there is nothing between us. There is no religion. The country should have a united
    liturgy and Muslim. And this, okay, this time when look at it, sorry, like Christians
    will rule in till 1960 to maybe 2020, then 2020 muslims will rule. Imagine it
    now the Christians imagine if Muslims have been winning consistently, the Christians
    will feel, the Christians will feel biased that probably, probably they are being
    cheated. But it will just be normal luck. But when everything is arranged according
    to religion, no one will feel bad cheated. So I believe that religion should be
    added to government.

    05:58:97


    06:00:99

    [Speaker 1]: You should play a role in government.


    06:00:99

    [Speaker 2]: Yes.

    06:00:99


    06:02:100

    [Speaker 1]: Okay. Thank you contribution. Thank you precious for your contribution.

  transcript: '00:00:97

    [Speaker 1]: Today we''ll be talking on a very interesting topic. Sickle cell
    disease. What can you say about this disease?

    00:06:96


    00:07:00

    [Speaker 2]: Okay. Sickle cell disease is actually a hematological disorder. It
    is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning that when it is inherited, except
    the two forms, two abnormal genes are inherited. If not, the person will not manifest
    with the disorder. So it is an autosomal recessive disorder which affect the beta
    chain of the. Of the globe of hemoglobin, you understand?  And then this beta
    chain, it''s actually. At position six of the chain where there is replacement
    of glutamine by valine. And then it causes the blood, the blood cell to be sickle
    instead of a normal biconcave disc shape of the blood, you understand? And it
    makes it non deformable or it doesn''t change shape easily when it is maneuvering
    or it''s passing through blood vessels. So therefore, when it reaches capillaries,
    I mean, tiny vessels in the body, it becomes very. When there is deoxygenation,
    it becomes sickle shape. And this sickle shape prevents it from maneuvering this
    blood vessel, negotiating these blood vessels, and it sticks to the wall of the
    blood vessel and then occludes the blood vessel, forming tactoids. And over time,
    if this process. If this process continues, it''s like a vicious cycle. Because
    of the deoxygenation, there is formation of this tactoid. And because of the formation
    of this tactoid, there''s further deoxygenation, which causes increased formation
    of this tactoid. And there''s an obstruction of blood vessel, and it manifests
    in various ways, you know, so which is usually called sickle cell crisis, the
    acute crisis of sickle cell, and then there are chronic crisis of sickle cell.

    01:40:99


    01:41:99

    [Speaker 1]: So from what I understand, from what you are saying, you are trying
    to say that sickle cell is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal hemoglobin,
    right?

    01:49:97


    01:49:97

    [Speaker 2]: Yes, that is correct.

    01:50:98


    01:50:98

    [Speaker 1]: That means the blood. What is the lifespan of a sickle cell blood
    and then a normal blood?

    01:55:98


    01:56:01

    [Speaker 2]: Usually the lifespan of a normal blood is about 120 days, while that
    of sickle cell blood, blood cell is about 10 to 20 days. Some say 10 to 30 days.

    02:07:99


    02:08:95

    [Speaker 1]: Okay, you mentioned something again. That sickle cell happens when
    a child receives two sickle cell genes.

    02:13:97



    02:13:99

    [Speaker 2]: Yes.

    02:14:95


    02:14:98

    [Speaker 1]: So why do. That''s one from each parent?

    02:16:96


    02:15:99

    [Speaker 2]: Yes.

    02:17:95


    02:17:95

    [Speaker 1]: That''s when two carriers AS and AS marry their self. They are likely
    to have a child with SS, the sickle cell hemoglobin.

    02:24:99


    02:24:99

    [Speaker 2]: Yes. or let me explain it. For someone, usually for someone with
    AS and AS, you understand? A is the normal, while S is the abnormal, which is
    a sickle cell. So AS - AS, when they get married, there''s a 25% chance that each
    of their child can come out as a sickler or as a sickle cell disease patient.
    I''m not saying that there''s a 25% child that all their children chance that
    all their children or their children will be sickle cell patient. No, it''s not
    as if when you give birth to one, two, three, the fourth one will be sickle cell
    patient. No, that is not the chance. The chances are each of the child. They give
    birth to has a 25% chance of being a sickler. So it is even possible that all
    your children will not be sickle cell patient. And it''s possible that all your
    children can still be. It''s possible that two of your children, maybe out of
    four, can be. So it''s just like that.

    03:20:96



    03:21:95

    [Speaker 1]: Okay, thank you. So what are the symptoms of this sickle cell?

    03:24:96


    03:24:98

    [Speaker 2]: Okay, I was talking about sickle cell crisis earlier. So the acute
    crisis include things like vaso-occlusive crisis, hyperhemolytic crisis, sequestration
    crisis, and aplastic crisis. So what is vaso occlusive crisis? Now, like I explained
    earlier, there is occlusion of the blood vessel by formation of this tactoid,
    and then this causes vaso occlusion. This is what they call vaso occlusion, and
    it leads to a crisis and painful

    03:53:01


    03:51:98

    [Speaker 1]: Can you please explain what occlusion means.

    03:53:97


    03:53:99

    [Speaker 2]: Okay. Occlusion means obstruction in a blood vessel.

    03:56:98


    03:56:98

    [Speaker 1]: Okay

    03:57:96


    03:57:97

    [Speaker 2]: Yeah. You know, the blood vessel is usually patents, allowing flow
    of blood. So when there is an obstruction by formation of this sickle cell, or
    tactoids, as the case may be, then it is called vaso occlusive crisis. And it
    can occur anywhere in the body, you understand? It can occur in the brain, where
    it is called cerebral crisis, acute cerebral crisis. It can occur in the chest,
    which is called acute chest syndrome. It can occur in the abdomen, which is called
    mesenteric crisis. It can occur in the penis, which is called priapism. It can
    occur in the bone. They call it bone pain crisis. You understand? And this crisis
    comes with pain, severe pain, usually, which they usually are admitted for. And
    this crisis can be precipitated by various activities or conditions, like infection,
    like malaria, for instance, can precipitate the crisis. Stress, stressful condition,
    dehydration extremes of temperature, like maybe high temperature or low temperature.
    So each of these conditions can predispose them to developing this crisis, you
    understand? So the second crisis is aplastic crisis, where there is infection
    of immature blood cells in the bone marrow by parvovirus B 19. And then this,
    if this affect the development of the maturation of this blood in the bone marrow,
    to normal blood. Blood cells, you understand? Or to mature blood cells, let me
    put it that way. So they become anemic. And then you see that they do not get
    enough. When they say a plastic means it''s coming from the bone marrow, there''s
    affectation of the red blood cell line from the bone marrow. Then the next crisis,
    which is a sequestration crisis, is as a result of pooling of blood from the systemic
    circulation into the spleen, usually it presents with abdominal swelling and distension,
    you understand? Because the spleen, they present with splenomegally, the spleen
    becomes very distended. And then it pulls the blood and then it leads to anemia,
    severe anemia, and usually managed on admission with careful transmission of aliquot.
    Although we are going of blood, although we are going to talk about management
    of this condition, second, then fourthly, which is the last crisis in acute crisis
    is the hyperhemolytic crisis. Like the name implies, hyper hemolytic may increase
    destruction of blood cells. You know, these blood cells are actually not, they''re
    actually not normal. So usually each time they flow through the, they flow through
    the spleen or it circulates through the spleen. They are usually tagged as abnormal
    blood because usually they have been affected in the systemic circulation when,
    where there is, anytime there is deoxygenation. So the spleen keeps destroying
    these blood cells. That''s why you always see them presenting with jaundice, you
    understand? Because there''s constant destruction of the breakdown of the red
    blood cell. So this leads to, this is what is called hyper hemolytic crisis.

    06:58:95


    06:58:99

    [Speaker 1]: Okay, so in summary, you''re saying that sickle cell patients may
    suffer from chronic anemia, fatigue, pain crisis, and then jaundice.

    07:08:00


    07:07:96

    [Speaker 2]: Yes. These ones I just listed are the acute crisis. They are chronic
    crisis too.

    07:13:99


    07:13:99

    [Speaker 1]: That''s like. Are they like the complications of sickle cell.

    07:16:96


    07:15:99

    [Speaker 2]: These are complications?

    07:17:00


    07:17:96

    [Speaker 1]: Yes. And I think they include things like organ damage.

    07:19:97


    07:19:99

    [Speaker 2]: Yeah. These are actually long term chronic crisis, Like

    07:24:95


    07:23:95

    [Speaker 1]:  Stroke

    07:24:00


    07:24:97

    [Speaker 2]: Exactly. It can, sickle cell can manifest as stroke.

    07:27:97


    07:27:98

    [Speaker 1]: What about infections? And then why do you think sickle cell patients,
    they usually have delayed growth like you see them, and then you see other normal
    children, they are all growing bigger. Then you see that the sickle cell child
    is left behind.

    07:39:97


    07:39:99

    [Speaker 2]: Yes, This is called failure to thrive. Failure to thrive because
    usually they don''t get enough oxygen. Their tissues don''t get enough oxygen.
    So you don''t expect the tissue that is not getting enough oxygen to grow well
    as normal as other cell, other people whose tissues are always getting enough
    oxygen. So they have this failure to thrive. Usually they''re usually smaller
    than their pairs and the fact that they''re always falling ill sick. So there
    are periods where they don''t even get to eat well because they are sick for a
    very long period of time. So it affects them. You understand? So we are just saying
    something about stroke.

    08:13:96


    08:13:97

    [Speaker 1]: Yes.

    08:14:97


    08:14:97

    [Speaker 2]: Usually in adults, it''s hemorrhagic stroke they do have. But in
    sickle cell patient, it is ischemic stroke. It''s chemical in the sense that they
    don''t get enough blood through the brain tissues, and then it leads to stroke.
    So let''s talk about the chronic crisis.

    08:29:95



    08:29:95

    [Speaker 1]: What about the infection? What kind of infection can they have?

    08:33:00


    08:32:96

    [Speaker 2]: They can have any kind of infection. They can have malaria, they
    can have pneumonia, they can have even bone infections like osteomyelitis.

    08:41:96


    08:41:99

    [Speaker 1]: Then finally, does the organ damage occur because there is no enough
    blood to this organ or is due to the infection? Like...

    08:51:00


    08:50:97

    [Speaker 2]: It can come from both ways, you understand? Like I mentioned earlier,
    stroke is like a focal neurological deficit, a sudden onset of focal neurological
    deficit. That means the brain is being damaged. So when there is ischemic stroke,
    of course, blood is not really getting enough to the brain. So it can cause damage,
    you understand, of the blood of the brain. So the same thing with other organs,
    too. Enough oxygen is not reaching them, or, you understand, it can cause damage
    because there''s like, kind of ischemia. There''s not sometimes occlusion of the
    blood vessels.

    09:20:100


    09:21:01

    [Speaker 1]: So what kind of medication do you think that sickle cell patients
    need? Like, actually, I know that they will have a lot

    09:27:98


    09:27:98

    [Speaker 2]: Okay, before, before I get to that, I want to talk a little about
    the chronic crisis, which we have. The cardiomyopathies affecting the heart. We
    have retinopathies, the... sorry sickle cell retinopathies affecting the retina
    of the eyes. And then we also have sickle cells, sickle cell nephropathy affecting
    the nephrons, you understand? So these are some of the chronic crisis. Over time,
    there''s accumulation, and then there''s repeated ischemia to these tissues, and
    then it affects them. You get the point. So now talking about management of sickle
    cell patients, it''s not a curable disease anyways. Although we''ve heard about
    stem cell transplants in developed countries, however, in a country like ours,
    usually is being managed. And management of this involves a lot of effort and
    involves a lot of understanding and cooperation between the patient, the caregiver
    of the patient, and also the hospital, the facility where the patient is actually
    being managed, you understand? So first of all, you give some medications which
    help them to prevent or reduce the number of crises they have.

    10:35:97


    10:35:97

    [Speaker 1]: Like pain relievers.

    10:36:98


    10:36:98

    [Speaker 2]: No, this in this case to prevent or to reduce the number of crises
    they have. I''m talking about medications like. Like malaria, chemoprophylaxis.
    This time around, it''s usually fansidar they give, you understand? So they give
    them fansidar once a month. That helps them to reduce or to prevent malaria, you
    understand? It''s a prophylaxis from malaria. Hydroxyurea is also given, which
    helps in increased production of fetal hemoglobin, which also have increased affinity
    for oxygen. It helps them reduce the crisis, the frequency of crisis as well.
    Then they are usually giving folic acid too, you understand? They are not giving
    iron because they have excess of iron from breakdown of red blood cells. So they
    are not usually giving iron.

    11:22:00


    11:22:00

    [Speaker 1]: I also heard that they advise to take water frequently, avoid stressful
    exposure, and then, and then exposure to extremes of temperature, like extremes
    of heat and cold. So how is it being managed when they''re in crisis?

    11:35:99


    11:38:00

    [Speaker 2]: Okay, it''s usually depending on the crisis they present with, you
    know? So for instance, for someone who presents with vessel occlusive crisis,
    you''re usually in pain, then they are giving. Usually management involve pain
    management. Where they are giving painkillers, usually they are giving pentazosine.
    And also you want to rehydrate them because some. Most times they come with dehydration
    and you are being rehydrated with one and a half maintenance, you understand?
    That is one and a half maintenance for normal individual. And then you want to
    also check whether they have infection, because most times infection precipitates
    like malaria or pneumonia, as the case may be. You also manage with antibiotics
    or appropriate antibiotics or anti-malarial to treat the infection. You also want
    to give oxygen if there is need for that. The same way if they present with acute
    chest syndrome, you follow this management and then you also want to give oxygen.
    You also want to do chest physiotherapy for them. And sometimes it may require
    for you to do exchange blood transfusion if there is no improvement. In the same
    way, if they''re present with sequestration crisis, you are going to transfer,
    you may have to transfuse them, but then you transfuse in aliquot. That is, you
    don''t transfuse everything at once because it is risky. The spleen may just decide
    to release the blood into the circulation at once and it will lead to excess blood
    in circulation, which is in itself is also bad.

    13:03:100


    13:04:99

    [Speaker 1]: I feel like instead of trying to find ways to manage this sickle
    cell, we should find ways to even prevent it from occurring at all. Like, how
    do you think apart from people advice to am people with the genotype AS and AS
    are advice not to marry each other. But some of them are not even aware of this.
    So I think there should be more awareness and more counseling. And then before
    marriage, people are supposed to go on screen and know their genotype. I hope
    you know your genotype.

    13:32:00


    13:32:96

    [Speaker 2]: Yes, I know my genotype and I agree with the point you are trying
    to make. It''s actually apart. So they are also. People are also to go for marriage
    counseling, you understand, especially by professionals in the society, like coming
    to hospital, as the case may be, or even if it''s in churches that are well informed,
    they should go for marriage counseling so that they''ll be counseled properly
    to avoid this condition, you understand? People also talked about permanent cure
    or treatment for this condition. Well, I heard in some countries, in some very
    advanced countries and facilities, they do stem cell transplants, your bone marrow
    transplant, and this helps to cure the condition. However, it is very expensive
    at the moment. Very few people can afford it. However, there are new researches
    going on. There are novel researches going on with the hope that they will come
    up with treatment modalities that can be affordable and that can lead to cure
    this condition. It is our hope that as time goes on, we will find a cure, a permanent
    cure for sickle cell anemia, And then this condition will not be a problem to
    the world.

    14:42:00


    14:42:100

    [Speaker 1]: Living with sickle cell can be very challenging on both the sickler
    and then the families and the loved ones of the sickle. And then I feel like we
    should give them all the support they need and then we should try to avoid anything
    that has to do with stigmatization of the disease and the people living with the
    disease. They should be allowed to have jobs that they can handle, that their
    health condition can handle, and then they should be allowed to socialize, and
    then they should be allowed to also have relationship study, some kind of course,
    all kind of courses that they actually desire. There should be no stigmatization.
    The whole society should come together to support these people, because already
    they are already going through a whole lot.

    15:19:96


    15:21:00

    [Speaker 2]: I agree with you on that.

    15:20:100


    15:21:97

    [Speaker 1]: And then once again, you are all advised to know your genotype. If
    you haven''t done that, try to do that today. And try to also let us all come
    together to totally eradicate sickle from our society, know your genotype.

    15:33:97


    15:33:98

    Speaker 2]: Know your genotype

    15:35:100


    15:33:98

    Speaker 1]: Know your genotype

  transcript: "00:01:99\n[Speaker 1]: So, Fajilo, nice having you once again. Well,\
    \ today we're going to be talking about which is more important, creativity or\
    \ knowledge. So, you know, what is different when you think about creativity and\
    \ knowledge? What strikes the difference between the two?\n00:15:04\n\n  00:17:03\n\
    [Speaker 2]: I think creativity, in modern society, creativity is more independence\
    \ than knowledge, because knowledge, someday, like knowledge, it comes, like through.\
    \ When you get knowledge. Some people, when attaining knowledge, they go through\
    \ government works and all those stuff. But creativity can be more independent.\n\
    00:38:03\n\n00:40:00\n[Speaker 1]: All right, so creativity is more. Knowledge\
    \ is more restricted. You gain knowledge from someone else. Creativity is inbound,\
    \ inborn, right. It's something that just comes from within, correct?\n00:51:100\n\
    \n00:51:100\n[Speaker 2]: Yes.\n00:52:00\n\n00:53:03\n[Speaker 1]: Okay. So the\
    \ debate over whether creativity or knowledge is more important has been a long\
    \ standing topic of discussion among philosophers, scholars, and innovators. Both\
    \ creativity and knowledge are essential elements in our lives. You agree with\
    \ me on that, but there is no consensus on which one should be given more weights.\
    \ Well, if you are to ask me, I would say both are very important. You need knowledge.\
    \ You, you. It's good to be creativity.\n01:20:03\n\n01:22:02\n[Speaker 2]: You\
    \ need. You actually need knowledge to apply the creative aspect that you have.\n\
    01:26:98\n\n01:28:01\n[Speaker 1]: Exactly. You need that knowledge. But if you\
    \ have only knowledge, without creativity, you are just like any other person.\
    \ There's nothing special about you. You need to be creative for your knowledge\
    \ to stand out. So, on one hand, knowledge is often perceived as the foundation\
    \ of progress and advancement, while on the other hand, creativity is viewed as\
    \ the driving force between innovation and originalism. In this ongoing debate,\
    \ some believe that knowledge enables individuals to think critically and solve\
    \ problems efficiently, while others argue that creativity allows for the exploration\
    \ of new ideas and solutions. Ultimately, the importance of creativity and knowledge\
    \ may depend on individual perspectives and context. So now for the. I want to\
    \ ask you a question. What do you think is the key to success? Is it being creative\
    \ or having vast knowledge on a topic.\n02:13:01\n\n02:14:100\n[Speaker 2]:  both\
    \ are more important, but I think it leans more towards creativity in the current\
    \ society that we are being creative, because knowledge. Knowledge is some. The\
    \ knowledge is the key to success, but when that knowledge isn't able to be applied\
    \ practically, won't really have any effect in society.\n02:36:99\n\n02:38:02\n\
    [Speaker 1]: Okay, so you. Creativity has a higher standing in the. If you have\
    \ to put it in the balance, creativity will be weighing higher, right?\n02:45:02\n\
    \n02:45:02\n[Speaker 2]: Yes.\n02:45:03\n\n02:47:00\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, I agree\
    \ with you on that. So what has been your personal experience in balancing creativity\
    \ and knowledge in your work or personal life.\n02:54:02\n\n02:58:02\n[Speaker\
    \ 2]: Like creative creativity. I'm still a second, I'm still a university student,\
    \ but when it comes to creativity, I'm more focused on artwork and stuff like\
    \ that.\n03:08:98\n\n03:10:03\n[Speaker 1]: All right, so how you are more focused\
    \ on artwork. Right. But you talked about you being a secondary school student,\
    \ right or  university student right. Okay, so you do know that there's a way\
    \ to apply creativity into your studies. Yes, there is. You know? Right. So what\
    \ comes, what kind of methods have you thought about and have you tried applying\
    \ them?\n03:36:01\n\n03:40:02\n[Speaker 2]: I personally, I haven't applied any\
    \ creative aspect to my, my university life, but I think when applying creativity\
    \ to your university life, stuff like engineering. When it comes to engineering,\
    \ there are some stuff you can do outside of academic work that can help you earn\
    \ money and stuff like that.\n04:02:98\n\n04:04:01\n[Speaker 1]: Okay. Okay. Yeah.\
    \ Being a bit fake, but I think I understand what you're trying to say. For me,\
    \ when I think about creativity in studies, I'm thinking about, oh, how you and\
    \ I are reading for both reason. Reading for 12 hours, right. In a day. Let's\
    \ just assume that I read every 12 hours in a day. You also read 12 hours in a\
    \ day. You read a whole 12 hours in a stretch. Maybe you only take breaks to eat\
    \ or have a short nap or something like that, but then I read for the same 12\
    \ hours. But then maybe every 30 minutes I take a break, I just draw something,\
    \ I scribble something down, or I just write a design or look up a dag, a cursive\
    \ handwriting, a new course of handwriting and put it down. You know, just things\
    \ that fancy my fancy, fancy my liking. For me, it's art. For somebody else, it\
    \ might be music. So you might just take that break and use to bring your brain\
    \ back to recover your brain, you know, drag your brain. Because the truth is\
    \ that when you study, your brain tends to wear like your brain is being strained.\
    \ So you have to bring jack your brain by bringing, rejuvenating it with things\
    \ that it actually likes. So somebody who's creative will put those things in\
    \ between reading times, while someone else who is like you, who is reading for\
    \ that 12 hours will only stop when he needs to. Like maybe he needs, he's feeling\
    \ sleepy, then he goes to take a nap, which is good. It's actually a great, it's\
    \ a great plan. And also maybe he needs to, he's hungry, he goes to take a simple\
    \ meal and come back. But I feel like the one who's taking breaks and being creative\
    \ about it is going to have grasp more because the brain is looking forward to\
    \ those breaks. I don't know if you get what I'm saying, but basically, I think\
    \ that's how you apply creativity to studies. There are many other ways you can\
    \ apply creativity to studies. Tooth tip of the iceberg. But also if you think\
    \ about many other aspects in life. Let's talk about football. Because I know\
    \ you love football. You can have all the knowledge about football that you want\
    \ to, but if you don't have the skills, you won't prosper. Right? And even if\
    \ you have the skills and you are playing football, if you're not creative about\
    \ it, you won't stand out. What do you think makes Ronaldo and Messi stand up?\
    \ They are creative about how they play. That's what makes them stand out in their.\
    \ In their field. So I feel like creativity is just a topping that makes you stand\
    \ out in whatever field you are in. If you're an engineering student, you stand\
    \ out. If you're a pharmacy student, you stand out. Is there anything you want\
    \ to add about this topic before we round off?\n06:33:98\n\n06:35:98\n[Speaker\
    \ 2]: I think that's all. Okay.\n06:35:99\n\n06:37:02\n[Speaker 1]: You don't\
    \ have anything else to add? Okay. Thank you very much, Fidel, for being here\
    \ today.\n06:39:03\n\n06:39:98\n[Speaker 2]: Thank you for having me.\n06:39:99"

  transcript: '00:01:01

    [Speaker 1]: Thank you so much for joining in the conversation. The topic I would
    like us to discuss how the western culture has affected African dressing. You
    see, Mr Haruna, over the centuries, the western culture has had a significant
    impact on African dressing. Isn''t it so?

    00:28:99


    00:29:02

    [Speaker 2]: Yeah, of course.

    00:30:02


    00:30:02

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah. So from the arrival of european explorers and missionaries
    to the influence of colonialism and the spread of western media and pop culture,
    the traditional attire and fashion of african cultures have been greatly influenced
    and adapted. Also, you see, the influence of western culture on african dressing
    has been profound, reshaping traditional attire and fashion trends in multi faceted
    ways from historical encounters to contemporary global interactions. This cultural
    exchange has produced a dynamic fusion of western and African styles, altering
    both aesthetics and production of clothing across the continent. And so now over
    to you, Mr Haruna. Do you have anything to say about how the western culture has
    affected the African dressing in any way?

    01:57:97


    01:58:00

    [Speaker 2]: Thank you very much, Fatima. Yes, of course, you know, I have a lot
    to say regarding this discussion or this topic, but I think, first of all, I would
    like you to, you know, first of all, you know, go through this question. You know,
    I know you are a professional, so I want you to, you know, enlighten us and, and
    educators briefly regarding this question. I''m going to ask you now, Fatima.
    I would like you to. What are your thoughts on how the influence of western culture
    has changed traditional African dressing styles and fashion trends? Do you think
    it has a positive or negative impact on preserving cultural identity through clothing?

    02:58:02


    03:00:02

    [Speaker 1]: Wow. Nice question, Mister Haruna. Okay, you asked the impact on
    traditional African dressing styles, right? And cultural identity, isn''t it?

    03:16:99


    03:17:01

    [Speaker 2]: Yeah.

    03:17:99


    03:17:99

    [Speaker 1]: You see, the impact of western culture on traditional african dressing
    styles has been extensive. You see, western fashion trends have introduced new
    materials, new designs and even new, you know, tailoring techniques into african
    clothing. Take for instance, the adoption of western style suits, dresses and
    casual wears has become prevalent, especially in urban centers. And this fusion
    has created a diverse and electic fashion scene in Africa, you know, blending
    indigenous motifs with modern cuts and fabrics. However, this influence has, you
    know, also raised concerns about the preservation of cultural identity through
    clothing. As western fashion gains prominence, there is a risk of diluting or
    overshadowing traditional African attire. And some argue that this shift undermines
    cultural authenticity and erodes unique sartorial practices that reflect african
    heritage. Yet others see it as, you know, a cultural evolution showcasing Africa''s
    adaptability and creativity in responding to global influences while maintaining
    cultural roots. So I think this is the little I can say for now. And, okay, over
    to you, Mr Haruna, what exactly is. Is one specific aspect or element of traditional
    African attire that you think has been influenced or adapted by western culture?
    So tell me, I want you to tell me, how do you feel about this incorporation and
    its impact on the overall style of African dressings?

    06:05:98


    06:09:00

    [Speaker 2]: All right, thank you so much, Fatima, for allowing me to say one
    or two things regarding this topic. You know, incorporation of traditional elements
    in western influence, Africa dressing. You know, one specific aspect of traditional
    Africa attire that has been, you know, influenced by western culture is the use
    of textiles, you know, and print, print and print, you know, traditional, traditional
    African fabrics like kanti, moth clothes and Ankara, you understand, have gained
    international recognition. Yes. Yes. And now, you know, incorporated into western
    fashion designs. So, you know, and this closer cultural exchange has elevated
    the status of Africa textiles globally and showcasing the beauty and craftsmanship
    of indigenous weaving and dying techniques. You know, the inco incorporate. The
    incorporation of our traditional element into western influence. African dressing
    has had a positive impact on the overall style. It has empowered, African designers
    to interpret traditional motives in contemporary context, appealing to broader
    audience while celebrating cultural heritage. This hybrid approach, this hybrid
    approach of fashion exemplifies the spirit of cultural fashion and innovation,
    you know, highlighting Africans rich history and creativity on the. On the. On
    the global stage. So, yeah, so I think, Fatima, can you make a conclusion, you
    know, regarding this topic we have just discussed so far?

    08:56:99


    08:58:00

    [Speaker 1]: Okay. All right. Thank you for your contribution.

    09:02:00


    09:02:01

    [Speaker 2]: Thank you very much.

    09:03:00


    09:03:00

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah. Thank you. You see, it''s essential, actually, to acknowledge
    the agency of African communities in navigating cultural exchanges and shaping
    their identity through clothing. You see, while western influence has undoubtedly
    left an indelible mark on African dressing, the ongoing dialogue between traditional
    and modernity continues to inspire new forms of sartorial expression that are
    both culturally rooted and globally resonant. Okay. This interplay underscores
    the transformative power of fashion as a conduct of, you know, cultural exchange,
    self expression in a rapid changing world. So I would like us to give a pause
    here. Thank you so much for joining in the conversation. Thank you for joining.

    10:24:98

  transcript: "00:01:94\n[Speaker 1]: Right, Victor? You're welcome. Today we'll be\
    \ talking about something that is popular, that is cut across almost all the cultures.\
    \ Something that a lot of people know about. And many people always look forward\
    \ to it. Victor, can you guess?\n00:21:98\n\n00:22:97\n[Speaker 2]: I can't guess.\n\
    00:23:00\n\n00:23:97\n[Speaker 1]: Okay.\n00:23:99\n\n00:23:100\n[Speaker 2]:\
    \ Is it birthday?\n00:24:98\n\n00:25:98\n[Speaker 1]: Exactly. Victor will be\
    \ talking about birthday today. So I know that everybody alive has a birthday.\
    \ But this time around, I don't know if everybody alive really does the birthday\
    \ celebration type of thing. So, Victor, can I know what you think of birthday?\
    \ What do you understand as birthday? Or what's? What's your simple explanation\
    \ or definition of a birthday?\n00:55:98\n\n00:56:99\n[Speaker 2]: Birthday, in\
    \ the simplest definition, is a special day set apart to remember the day you\
    \ were born. And its mostly held on the month and the dates that you were giving\
    \ birth to. Your official date of birth.\n01:12:98\n\n01:13:95\n[Speaker 1]: Okay,\
    \ so birthday is something that people. celebrate every year right? To remember\
    \ the other year or the other, other, other year that they were giving birth to.\n\
    01:25:95\n\n01:25:95\n[Speaker 2]: Yeah.\n01:25:97\n\n01:26:94\n[Speaker 1]: Okay\
    \ and its celebrated the same day and month. Okay, so, Victor, this birthday celebration,\
    \ I learned that its for only rich people, that poor people don't celebrate birthday.\
    \ Do you think that is true?\n01:42:96\n\n01:43:95\n[Speaker 2]: Poor people don't\
    \ celebrate birthday. Actually, actually its subjective, because some rich people\
    \ don't like celebrating their birthday.\n01:55:97\n\n01:56:97\n[Speaker 1]: Okay.\n\
    01:56:99\n\n01:57:95\n[Speaker 2]: But I'll not remove the fact that to celebrate\
    \ your birthday, you actually need money. So, some people, because of their poor,\
    \ they have many problems in their lives, so birthday is the least of their worries.\
    \ So, the highest they can get on their birthday is just a happy birthday. But\
    \ most times they just even forget their birthday because they're going through\
    \ a lot. So birthday is the last thing on their mind.\n02:22:95\n\n02:23:97\n\
    [Speaker 1]: So what you're saying is that a lot of people don't remember to really\
    \ celebrate \ntheir birthday probably because of what they are facing.\n02:32:96\n\
    \n02:32:98\n[Speaker 2]: Yes.\n02:34:00\n\n02:33:96\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, Victor,\
    \ can I know when last you celebrated your birthday?\n02:39:98\n\n02:40:100\n\
    [Speaker 2]: Just a few months ago.\n02:41:100\n\n02:42:94\n[Speaker 1]: Few months\
    \ ago?\n02:44:00\n\n02:43:95\n[Speaker 2]: Yes.\n02:43:97\n\n02:43:99\n[Speaker\
    \ 1]: Okay, so that few months ago, did you really remember that it was your birthday\
    \ or someone reminded you?\n02:49:98\n\n02:49:98\n[Speaker 2]: No, I remembered.\
    \ I remembered. But obviously, sometimes I used to forget it's my birthday. Like,\
    \ the previous year, I forgot it was my birthday. My birthday passed. Like, can\
    \ you imagine, like, for somebody to forget the day they were born. Like, I didn't\
    \ put too much value into birthday, because I felt birthday is just an ordinary\
    \ day like, it's just. So if I should be sadistic, some people do view birthdays\
    \ as one year closer to your death. So to them its not something special. Just\
    \ another day, just a day they were born. Nothing much. Nothing. Nothing to see\
    \ there.\n03:29:98\n\n03:31:97\n[Speaker 1]: Alright. So you, few months ago,\
    \ you celebrated your birthday. Can I know, Victor, if there is any of those,\
    \ your birthdays that you find very, very special or the one that had some events\
    \ that made you, it very memorable for you. That you can say, I can't forget my\
    \ second two years old birthday, three years old birthday or any of those.\n03:56:95\n\
    \n03:56:96\n[Speaker 2]: I can't actually remember the year or the age I was in\
    \ but I'll not call it my personal birthday. Because on my personal birthday,\
    \ the highest they did for me, was happy birthday and it ends there. Nothing special.\
    \ Maybe my mom bought chicken that day and we cooked it, just a remembrance of\
    \ me and ended there. No special events, no special stuff happened but something\
    \ later happened. Because few weeks after that, my parents decided to do a general\
    \ birthday to celebrate everybody in our house. So we did it in a large way. My\
    \ parents invited people to our house, our compound. We celebrated all our birthdays\
    \ in one day. I know it's funny it's funny yeah. It does not normally happen in\
    \ some families.\n04:49:98\n\n04:49:98\n[Speaker 1]: Family of Victor Demas.\n\
    04:51:96\n\n04:51:96\n[Speaker 2]: It does not happen in some families but my\
    \ father had to do it and that day, something special happened. My father did\
    \ us a special surprise. He bought us really expensive, table tennis board where\
    \ we can use and play table tennis. So up to date, that table tennis is still\
    \ there. So, I think that was the most memorable birthday celebration. Even though\
    \ it was not my birthday. It was a family birthday. It was the most memorable.\
    \ Something close to a memory birthday I had.\n05:26:96\n\n05:27:97\n[Speaker\
    \ 1]: So say the one that you people had generally as a family was your most memorable\
    \ birthday. Wow. So outside that, your normal birthday, what, don't you think\
    \ about, cake? Because, I learned that, I see that most people, they see birthday\
    \ as a day that they have to purchase cake or eat cake or I, share cakes to their\
    \ friends. Do you think that without cake there will be no birthday or something?\
    \ Birthday celebration. Do you think that cake is extremely necessary for birthday?\
    \ That people cannot celebrate birthday without cake?\n06:19:99\n\n06:23:96\n\
    [Speaker 2]: Birthday is a symbol of, sorry, cake is a symbol of birthdays. Like,\
    \ it's something attached to birthdays. Like, literally, if you see a cake with\
    \ candles in a picture, obviously, you know, it was, its used to remember somebody's\
    \ birthday. It signifies birthday. Just like, chicken, like turkey, represents\
    \ Easter, thanksgivings.\n06:49:95\n\n06:49:98\n[Speaker 1]: Yeah.\n06:49:99\n\
    \n06:50:97\n[Speaker 2]: Same way with bunnies represents Easter thanksgiving.\
    \ Rice, rice and stew represent Sundays.\n06:59:95\n\n07:00:100\n[Speaker 1]:\
    \ That's Nigeria only.\n07:01:95\n\n07:01:96\n[Speaker 2]: Nigeria only. So cake\
    \ represent birthdays. It's, it's, I don't know where the tradition started, but\
    \ it has been there for a long time.\n07:09:100\n\n07:09:95\n[Speaker 1]: Do you\
    \ think it's Nigerian tradition or it's foreign?\n07:13:00\n\n07:12:96\n[Speaker\
    \ 2]: Should be foreign because our old fathers never knew what cake was.\n07:16:98\n\
    \n07:17:94\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, so how do you think that your old father celebrated\
    \ their birthday? Or they don't celebrate birthday?\n07:24:96\n\n07:24:98\n[Speaker\
    \ 2]: I don't think they celebrated their birthday.\n07:25:100\n\n07:25:100\n\
    [Speaker 1]: So what you're saying that birthday is not a tradition of your ancestral\
    \ home?\n07:30:94\n\n07:30:95\n[Speaker 2]: Because if you ask some of these,\
    \ our great grandfathers and our grandfathers that are still alive, some people\
    \ are lucky to have their grandfathers. That's, that's actually good. So, but\
    \ if you ask them, most of them don't know their age.\n07:42:96\n\n07:42:99\n\
    [Speaker 1]: Okay.\n07:43:96\n\n07:43:96[Speaker 2]: They don't know their age\
    \ and that just tells you that they don't keep track of their age and if they\
    \ don't keep the track of age, obviously they were not celebrating their birthday.\
    \ They were not being reminded that this was the day they were born. Because if\
    \ they were remembering this, was the day they're born, they will not, they will\
    \ actually remember the dates they were born and they will be able to calculate\
    \ their age.\n08:01:95\n\n08:01:95\n[Speaker 1]: So they don't really put much\
    \ emphasis in birthday, then. Wow, the old people really missed a lot. So old\
    \ people, I think that's true, actually, because I barely remember that when my\
    \ grandmother died, we had to guess her age by estimate. It wasn't really her\
    \ exact age that was written on the poster. So we have to go through her age mates\
    \ to discover maybe the age, her age.\n08:32:98\n\n08:33:97\n[Speaker 2]: Yeah.\n\
    08:33:99\n\n08:35:94\n[Speaker 1]: So if you have kids, would you like to introduce\
    \ them to birthday celebration?\n08:40:97\n\n08:42:95\n[Speaker 2]: If I have\
    \ kids, obviously.\n08:43:98\n\n08:43:99\n[Speaker 1]: Are you, will you celebrate\
    \ them just normal, happy birthday, like you were raised.\n08:50:96\n\n08:51:98\n\
    [Speaker 2]: To have a limit for the first few years of their life, I'll be celebrating\
    \ a birthday, but, as they grow older, I think I'll dial down on the way I celebrate\
    \ their birthday. You can just be happy, wish then and maybe send them money.\
    \ If I'm capable, I'll be sending them money. Happy birthday, take this as your\
    \ birthday gift, that kind of thing. But not to come and do a ceremony to celebrate\
    \ a birthday. But it's very essential you do a ceremonious birthday for your kids\
    \ in their first few years of life. Maybe their first birthday, second birthday,\
    \ fifth birthday, 6th birthday. But as a grow older, the birthday ceremonies thing,\
    \ you can dial it down the beach and just do like a small gifting to them just\
    \ to remind them that you love them and make them feel special on their birthday.\n\
    09:38:97\n\n09:38:99\n[Speaker 1]: Okay? So what you're saying is that those early\
    \ age of their life where they take pictures and all that, that is very necessary\
    \ that you celebrate their birthday for them, at least for the sake of memory.\
    \ Alright, Victor, I appreciate your input on this issue of birthday. So I believe\
    \ to see you around again for more discussion. Thank you so much, Victor.\n10:06:97\n\
    \n10:07:95\n[Speaker 2]: Yeah, thank you very much.\n10:08:96"

  transcript: '00:00:02

    [Speaker 1]: Okay, so we''ll be looking at heart diseases, and by way of introduction,
    we see that heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, refers to a range
    of conditions that affect the heart and its functions. These include coronary
    artery disease, heart failure, arrhythmias, and congenital heart defects, among
    others. Now, do you have anything to say about that?

    00:22:99


    00:23:96

    [Speaker 2]: Okay. Heart disease is recently one of the sudden causes of death
    in our environment. And like you said, it ranges from diseases like myocardial
    infarction, congestive cardiac failure, hypertension, congenital defects as well,
    and usually a compendium of diseases that affect the heart and the blood vessels
    and have a ripple effect in the environment.

    00:45:97


    00:45:100

    [Speaker 1]: Okay, true. Okay. So, going further, I would like to go into have
    an overview, rather, of some symptoms of heart diseases. And we see that symptoms
    can vary depending on the specific heart condition. But some common symptoms now
    could include chest pain, which is also known as angina, shortness of breath,
    fatigue or weakness, palpitations that''s irregular or fast heartbeats, swelling
    in the legs, ankles and feet, dizziness or lightheadedness, nausea or indigestion.
    Do you have anything further to say about this?

    01:20:98


    01:20:98

    [Speaker 2]: Okay, so, for the symptoms you just mentioned, it varies according
    to the heart condition. So, in some heart conditions, like congestive cardiac
    failure, you can see shortness of breath, also known as dyspnoea, where the individual
    finds it difficult to breathe in. And usually when there''s the heart condition,
    it has an effect on the lungs and leads to pulmonary edema, where it obstructs
    and blocks the alveoli, so making breathing difficult. Also, the individual can
    notice fatigue or weakness and inability to do certain activities compared to
    before. Usually he will be able to run certain distances, but he will not be able
    to anymore. Those are also symptoms of cardiac diseases. Also, chest pain, like
    you mentioned, angina pectoris, where there''s pain around the region of the chest
    can also be a presentation of cardiovascular diseases. Palpitations, which is
    irregular or fast heartbeats, can also present as heart, as cardiac conditions,
    you can have edema, which is what you know as swelling in the legs, where the
    person''s leg, ankle, or feet can be swollen, it can be pitting or non-pitting
    edema. Also, nausea, vomiting, indigestion and dizziness, so to mention, but a
    few. These are some of the risks, and these are some of the symptoms of cardiovascular
    diseases.

    02:41:97


    02:41:98

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah. Alright. So, talking about risk factors for heart diseases,
    we see that they can be divided into modifiable and non-modifiable factors. Now,
    let''s go into modifiable factors. We have high blood pressure, which is hypertension,
    high cholesterol levels, smoking, diabetes, overweight or obesity, physical inactivity,
    unhealthy diet, excessive alcohol consumption, stress and poor mental health,
    and a whole lot of others. And then going into non-modifiable, we see age, we
    see family, we see gender, we see ethnicity. So, do you have anything about modifiable
    risk factors?

    03:28:00


    03:29:00

    [Speaker 2]: Okay, for the modifiable risk factors, these are risk factors that
    change can be, can be affected.

    03:38:96


    03:38:100

    [Speaker 1]: Yes.

    03:39:01


    03:39:96

    [Speaker 2]: So, these risk factors are not, are not genetic, they are not inbuilt,
    you can do something about them. So, for example, smoking. So, smoking poses a
    very, very high-risk cardiovascular diseases. An individual who smokes is at risk
    of different cardiovascular diseases, like atherosclerosis, that will eventually
    lead to hypertension, that will lead to congestive cardiac failure. So, obesity
    is another risk factor. An individual who is overweight beyond normal for his
    age and weight is going to tend towards having cardiovascular complications. So
    also, someone who has a sedentary lifestyle, who has less of physical activity,
    who usually doesn''t do much, can also pose a risk for cardiovascular disease.
    Someone who does not exercise, someone who consumes unhealthy diets, that consumes
    a lot of fully unsaturated fats, is also at risk of cardiovascular diseases. Someone
    with high cholesterol levels, too much intake of alcohol and stress, to mention
    but a few. All of these are modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.

    04:46:97


    04:46:99

    [Speaker 1]: Okay, and how about the non-modifiable.

    04:49:98


    04:49:99

    [Speaker 2]: Okay, for the non-modifiable risk factors. These risk factors, generally,
    these risk factors are in the individual and, for example, age. An individual
    who is older has a risk for more cardiovascular diseases because with age, the
    blood vessels become harder, there''s thickening, there''s fibrosis. This can
    predispose one to hypertension and subsequent cardiovascular disease. Also, a
    person who has a positive family history for a heart disease can also have a heart
    disease. For example, the father had myocardial infraction. He or she can also
    have myocardial infarction. For gender, usually men have a higher risk for cardiovascular
    diseases than female, and for some races, they are also predisposed to cardiovascular
    diseases.

    05:38:98


    05:38:98

    [Speaker 1]: Alright, that''s very, very true. So, let''s talk about the prevention
    of heart diseases. So, we see that preventing heart disease now involves managing
    risk factors and making healthy lifestyle choices. So, talking about healthy diets,
    we see that person should consume a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains,
    lean proteins, and healthy fats and should also limit intake of saturated fats,
    trans fats, cholesterol, sodium and added sugar. And we also see in the aspect
    of stress, managing stress. A person should practice relaxation techniques such
    as meditation, yoga or deep breathing exercises. We also see regular health checks,
    checkups. Monitor your blood pressure consistently, cholesterol also and blood
    sugar levels regularly. Follow medical advice and take prescribed medications
    as directed. We also see avoid smoking and limit alcohol. Now, do you have anything
    to say about smoking? Like avoiding smoking and limiting alcohol?

    06:50:01


    06:50:100

    [Speaker 2]: Okay. Yes. Yes. That is very, very, very important. That is very,
    very, very important. So, there''s almost no benefit of smoking? Yes, smoking
    should be avoided, limit your alcohol intake, manage stress, go for regular health
    checkups to check your blood pressure and be sure that you are on track. And do
    make sure you stay hydrated, maintain a healthy body weight, get enough sleep,
    get enough rest as well.

    07:25:96


    07:25:98

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah, that''s true. Okay, so now i''ll want to ask a question. So,
    what are some lifestyle changes that you have made to lower your risk of developing
    heart disease?

    07:37:97


    07:37:99

    [Speaker 2]: Okay, so for lifestyle changes, things like exercise, exercising
    regularly and as often as possible. Yes. Also, good diets, healthy diets, reducing
    the level of junk and taking more fruits and vegetables can help to reduce the
    risk of cardiovascular diseases. Good rest, avoiding alcohol intake and smoking
    can also reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

    07:58:01


    08:06:97

    [Speaker 1]: All true. Thank you so much.

    08:08:97

  transcript: '00:01:97

    [Speaker 1]: So in our society today, we have witnessed a rapid increase in the
    hike in oil prices, in price of oil around the world and in our country today.
    So what do you think has been the biggest factor? What do you think are the causes
    that''s contributed to the increase in oil prices?

    00:29:00


    00:29:98

    [Speaker 2]: I think the number one cause that increased the petrol price in Nigeria
    for a case study is the removal of subsidy by the new government. And also there
    have been some conflicts between the oil producing states that has actually affected
    the production of oil and oil bunkering and a lot of factors like the oil bunkering
    now, there are some communities in Niger Delta for example, for instance, where
    this oil has been extracted from and these communities are not receiving even
    like palliative from the government which has caused them to cause, to bring up
    a resistance group. The resistance group is not like the Ijaw people resistance
    group where these people go to oil pipes and break oil pipes, take oil illegally,
    sell it in black market. And a lot of atrocities have been done by these people
    due to the inability of the government to at least give them some stipends. Because
    you are taking oil from their, from their environment, from their communities
    and you are causing more environmental pollutions without being compensating them,
    which is causing a lot of effects on their children. The waters there are so,
    so bad. The health issue, the health care, everything just going wrong for them
    in that, in that community. So how do you expect them not to form a resistance
    group or not to try and fight for their right, even though they might be fighting
    in the wrong manner. But still they have justifications for some of their cries
    and their plea to the government.

    02:38:00


    02:39:02

    [Speaker 1]: And these issues lead to increase in oil prices because they lead
    to shortage of oil and they have to make profit. So the price of petroleum increased
    and another cause of the hike in fuel prices, international conflict as well,
    like the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, has led to an increase in crude
    oil per barrel that led to a rapid increase in crude oil per barrel and this affects
    the oil price as well because now the barrel is being sold for a higher price.
    So after the crude has been refined, they have to sell the petroleum products
    and other byproducts of the crude at a higher price. So this also is another cause
    of the hike in oil prices. And it has a lot of impact on the economy. So visible
    impact, so obvious impacts on the economy. If, because many countries like country
    Nigeria now depends our main source of revenue is from oil. So if the price of
    oil goes up, you expect all other things to follow. Because we are mainly dependent
    on oil. Dependent on oil for transportation, depend on oil as well for industries.
    So if the price goes up, all other parts of the economy will grow up too. And
    this one of the major effects is that it leads to increase in price of goods and
    services of products. Because manufacturers use fuel for their machines in industry
    and they have to now they are buying it at a higher price. So it affects the price
    of what they produce as well. And in all aspects, both in agriculture, in transport
    industry, the rate of transportation also increase. And due to the effects of
    the hike in oil price. And if I may ask, what has been your personal experience
    that I have encountered with the rising oil price? That you have encountered.

    04:46:98


    04:47:97

    [Speaker 2]: Rising oil price especially in my country, Nigeria has really caused
    a lot of issue in terms of food. Like you go to the market today, you buy a particular
    commodity for a particular price. Then the next day the price increase or triple
    save in some cases due to the increment, increase in oil price. Because even our
    oil are being sold when we transport them that we have been. We transport them
    using dollar. And whenever the dollar goes up automatically, the oil price also
    goes, will go up. Which will have other effects on the. Our goods and services
    that we buy. Even regular trans transport also became. We will become very, very
    expensive. This um. All these increments already has caused a lot of increment
    in poverty in our community. Because you can''t. There is no increment in salaries
    and everything is increasing. So there is hike in every goods. So it would be
    impossible for people to buy, that are collecting minimal salary to also buy goods.

    06:15:98


    06:16:98

    [Speaker 1]: And the effect it has an enormous effect on people in rate of, like
    you talk about poverty, people are unable to afford people are getting poorer
    and the minimum wage has not been increased. So it makes people not to be able
    to afford the things they can buy before because the old price has increased.
    And I think some solutions that can be. That can be preferred is one. If they
    can resolve the conflict in all these countries are cause the increase of crude
    go up. If there can be less wars among nations, it will greatly reduce the price
    of oil. And even within the country as well, If conflict and within communities
    where crude are being extracted from. If they can come into a peaceful resolution,
    I think it also affects the price and it will bring it down. And also corruption
    as well. There''s a high rate of corruption in our country that has cause the
    fuel price to increase because people are stealing fuel, and those are in government
    are secretly stealing the fuel, making it short and making the price to go high.
    So if you can address all these issues, I believe that, the fuel, the price, the
    hike in price of fuel will greatly reduce. I need to have a good effects on the
    economy. Things will be balanced, and people will be able to afford the common
    things that they could afford before.

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah.

    00:00:95

    [Speaker 2]: Thank you.

    00:00:98


    00:01:95

    [Speaker 1]: So our topic today is child marriage. And over the years, child marriage
    is a widespread social and human rights issue where individuals below the age
    of 18 are married, often without their consent. And this practice, it affects
    girls who are forced into marriage before their physical, mental and emotional
    maturity. So what do you know about child marriage in this part of the world?

    00:24:99


    00:25:96

    [Speaker 2]: Okay. Generally, I believe child marriage should actually be termed
    a life threatener because I believe it stresses the life of children. It stresses
    their well being. There is a joy in expressing childhood, and I believe through
    child marriage that cannot be achieved. So it actually aborts the future of people.
    Yes, child children in particular.

    00:52:00


    00:51:96

    [Speaker 1]: That''s very true. So I read an article about child marriage in certain
    parts of the world still being a common practice even in the northern part of
    Nigeria. It''s still a very common practice in northern part of Nigeria. What
    are your thoughts on this issue?

    01:03:98


    01:04:95

    [Speaker 2]: I believe in the northern part of Nigeria, to be specific, although
    I would say that is not, the only part, that is the only tribe per se, that is
    only performing the act. But I believe that''s where it is most common. And I
    think it''s something that has been. That people have been. People of influence
    have been trying to curb. They have been trying to put an end to it. But this
    is something that has been ingrained deep in their culture and in their tribe,
    and I believe issue, and I believe it will take a long while for it to actually
    be. I don''t even believe it can be completely eradicated. But I believe with
    education, health education, with acknowledging that, okay, these are the repercussions,
    these are the consequences. These are the even health related issues that can
    come from it, then I believe we should be able to work better on it.

    01:59:97


    02:01:97

    [Speaker 1]: Oh, that''s a very good point of view. So this child marriage affects
    people because it denies them of their chance to education, their health, and
    even development. How do you think child marriage can affect a young child, a
    young girl, for instance?

    02:17:94


    02:18:97

    [Speaker 2]: Okay, the first thing is, I believe it''s, let''s talk about the
    body generally, or the feeling it''s lower self esteem, because that is mostly
    gender inequality. If you are talking about child, you don''t see a is, let''s
    say a 15 boy, a 15 year old boy or a 14 year old boy getting married. They would
    definitely put him into work, maybe to learn work or to work on farms or something
    like that. But when it comes to female, you see 12, 13, 14 getting married already.
    So I believe that that is gender inequality and will lower children''s self esteem.
    Then apart from that, there are practices that children shouldn''t even be aware
    of yet, like sex. That is something. Child shouldn''t have a full knowledge of
    what it entails. And I believe child marriage, we put the children at the forefront
    of experiencing and participating in sex, even against their consent. So. And
    I believe it''s also robbed girls of their childhood and it threatens their well
    being. This is, there''s something called. So this is a very prominent and a very
    prominent health issue that deals with child marriage, especially girls. And this
    is very prominent among girls of that experience. Child Yes, child marriage. So.
    And they become pregnant at some points. There are lots of pregnancy weeks that
    also comes in place because they are just so young, their body is not ready for
    it. So that is what I believe

    03:50:95


    03:50:95

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. This is true. And just like
    you said, it will lower their self esteem and expose. Expose them to harmful levels
    of domestic violence and abuse and also a violation of human rights, just like
    you said.

    04:01:97


    04:01:97

    [Speaker 2]: It also takes a heavy toll on their mental health, because even people
    that are old and they are giving birth, they have post, there''s something called
    postpartum after birth. So they experience postpartum depression, postpartum bipolar
    disorder, a lot of things like that. So imagine if a younger person is now experiencing
    all those at the same time with other health issues. I believe that could actually
    kill a child. So we can. We can just say child marriage is a killer of this thing.

    04:31:99


    04:32:96

    [Speaker 1]: That is true. And generally, or should I say globally, efforts have
    been made to end child marriage and protect the rights of children to save an
    healthy childhood. So what do you think we can do as a country to prevent child
    marriage or protect the rights of these children?

    04:49:98


    04:50:00

    [Speaker 2]: Okay. To reiterate what I already said in the previous conversation.
    So in the beginning of the conversation. So I will say they should, they really
    need to educate. Okay. I know it''s not easy, because some people are so embedded
    in their culture, in their tradition and say I want to make my culture proud.
    I want to elevate my culture and things like that. So. But I believe with health
    education, with not only health education, with telling them the repercussions
    of this thing, with them saying it with their eyes, and not just keeping those
    children and stigmatizing them, bring them out. This is what has happened to this
    person. This is what has happened to this person. Let us learn from it. Let us
    desert from these things. So I believe it should also work and people should.
    I believe the law should also take a part in this. There should be a law side
    or there should be a law that. Okay. If there''s anybody that is giving his or
    her child and in marriage and the child is less than 21, I believe there should
    be a court of law that goes against that or that punishes those offenders, just
    like how we have sex offenders.

    05:53:96


    05:53:96

    [Speaker 1]: That is very true. That is very true. You said it all. Thank you
    very much. it was nice having this conversation with you

    What is yours?


    00:17:99

    [Speaker 1]: My favorite book is I just like any book written by Colin Hoover
    and Karen Kingsbury and Francis Rivers.


    00:25:97

    [Speaker 2]: So why do you like their books?


    00:27:100

    [Speaker 1]: Because they have like their concepts. Book writing is very good.
    Okay, who is your favorite author?


    00:39:98

    [Speaker 2]: I think I like Sydney Sheldon.


    00:42:97

    [Speaker 1]: Okay. I know him.


    00:45:99

    [Speaker 2]: His books are very. How like put it. They are intriguing.


    00:51:96

    [Speaker 1]: Yes.


    00:51:96

    [Speaker 2]: He always has, like you can''t expect.


    00:53:99

    [Speaker 1]: Yes. Suspense. There''s always suspense. And he''s my dad''s favorite
    author too. And what book, like, what''s your favorite book of his?


    01:05:97

    [Speaker 2]: Master of the game boy. It''s very long.


    01:08:97

    [Speaker 1]: What is it about? Talk about.


    01:12:95

    [Speaker 2]: It''s about. I don''t know, it''s about one guy, bar, that was like
    cheated in business. When he started, he was backstabbed. So for his like revenge,
    he now came back to, how I put it now to take vengeance on all those people, like
    to their generations, their grandchildren, all of them, he still came back to
    like revenge. What his would I say? What their great grandfather now did to him.


    01:39:00

    [Speaker 1]: Oh, that''s nice. My favorite book of conning Hoover''s is verity.
    And I like Verity because it''s like out of her comfort zone kinda, because normally
    she writes about romance. And just like most of her books are, most of her books
    are predictable. But this one, it had a lot of like plot twists and a lot of.


    02:02:99

    [Speaker 2]: Even the endings.


    02:02:99

    [Speaker 1]: Yes. Like the middle was like. Ah. Then the ending just like made
    everything just go. Exactly. And um. What other book do you like?


    02:12:96

    [Speaker 2]: Um, there''s this. Colleen Hoover''s book. It was not all that shabbo,
    it still had all those. Plenty plot twists. I think the name is 13 minutes or
    so. Have you seen it?


    02:26:97

    [Speaker 1]: No.


    02:26:97

    [Speaker 2]: About one girl that drowned for like 30 minutes. Then she now. But
    they rescued her and then like she was still alive. One funny thing like that.


    02:35:100

    [Speaker 1]: Oh, I''ve never heard of it. I''m going to go and read it now. Um,
    have you read November 9?


    02:42:97

    [Speaker 2]: Yes. Wait. Yes, the one.


    02:44:99

    [Speaker 1]: I think November 9 is about fire. Is it now?


    02:47:97

    [Speaker 2]: I''m sorry, I used to confuse them because it''s just similar.


    02:51:97

    [Speaker 1]: There''s one about fire that she got burnt and then she had a scar
    and she was insecure about. That''s what I''m saying. November 9.


    03:02:00

    [Speaker 2]: Now I think. I don''t know.


    03:02:99

    [Speaker 1]: And then that was the date, right? That she got. Yeah. So, like,
    every anniversary of that day, I think she and her dad used to go for, like, lunch
    or dinner or something. I can''t remember. The book is really.


    03:18:95

    [Speaker 2]: It''s confusing. I can''t really remember that. But you''ve read
    it ends with us.


    03:18:95

    [Speaker 1]: Yes, it ends with us. What do you think about what''s his name? Is
    it Gavin?


    03:26:96

    [Speaker 2]: I can''t remember their names. But the main guy sha.


    03:29:00

    [Speaker 1]: The one that. No, the one that had violence in him.


    03:32:95

    [Speaker 2]: And that''s what me, I feel like.


    03:32:95

    [Speaker 1]: You feel like he''s justified.


    03:34:100

    [Speaker 2]: No, he was just using it as an excuse. Yes, because every time, like,
    any time, it will happen that maybe he''ll beat her or he''ll do something. So
    he always had. He always had an excuse for it. Like that first time when it happened,
    he said he did not know what made him push her. How won''t you know what will
    make you push somebody?


    03:50:98

    [Speaker 1]: Especially after the fact that, um. Is it his sister that told her
    that he killed somebody? He killed his brother when he was younger or something
    like that? Or is it him that told her that he killed his brother when he was younger?
    So he had that trauma. So I feel like maybe because he couldn''t heal from that
    trauma. That''s why it was always haunting him.


    04:09:97

    [Speaker 2]: And he''s still paying me. That did not end up together. As toxic
    as it was.


    04:12:100

    [Speaker 1]: It was very toxic.


    04:15:00

    [Speaker 2]: I still felt like I wanted him to get that.


    04:18:00

    [Speaker 1]: But the line was crossed when he put. Pushed her down the stairs.
    Yes, that''s it. And then was it the time? Was she pregnant twice? Or is it just
    one?


    04:26:100

    [Speaker 2]: No, I think it was just once. She gave birth now to.


    04:29:96

    [Speaker 1]: I was thinking maybe she had a miscarriage at first. Okay.


    04:29:96

    [Speaker 2]: No, I don''t think so.


    04:31:100

    [Speaker 1]: So she was just pregnant once. And then when she. Now. I like the
    part that she. After she gave birth to the child, she now told him that this is
    over. And she now gave him that scenario of, if your daughter comes to tell you
    that somebody, her man, used to beat her and everything, would you tell her to
    stay with him? And then he said no. That''s when he now realized. What nigerian
    author have you like? Which book?


    05:00:96

    [Speaker 2]: I don''t think I can.


    05:02:97

    [Speaker 1]: Have you read them? Have you read that Legos book? What''s it called?


    05:08:99

    [Speaker 2]: Nearly all the men in Lagos.


    05:11:96

    [Speaker 1]: Have you read it?

    05:11:96

    [Speaker 2]: Yes, I''ve read it.


    05:13:95

    [Speaker 1]: What''s your thoughts?


    05:13:95

    [Speaker 2]: Men are mad. Men are crazy.


    05:15:99

    [Speaker 1]: I swear.


    05:17:98

    [Speaker 2]: Like that one that his wife was like the breadwinner of everything.


    05:20:98

    [Speaker 1]: That facebook.


    05:20:98

    [Speaker 2]: Yeah. And she was now feeling bad about it that her boss told her
    that she should come for, like, a vacation. And he was even angry. Why didn''t
    she go?


    05:30:96

    [Speaker 1]: He''s the one that was pushing her to, like, go, go. And then when
    she now went and nothing really. Okay, things happened, but, like, when she came
    back, things were never the same again.


    05:39:99

    [Speaker 2]: How will it be the same?


    05:41:100

    [Speaker 1]: But he was collecting the watch and.


    05:45:100

    [Speaker 2]: Everything, raping somebody else.


    05:45:100

    [Speaker 1]: He actually.


    05:48:95

    [Speaker 2]: Yes, he actually did. It was when she read. Because she kept on defending
    her husband. It was not when she read the girl''s story and then she saw that
    particular line that hopefully her husband.


    05:58:98

    [Speaker 1]: That''s when I knew that men are. Men are wicked.


    06:01:98

    [Speaker 2]: The one I read, sha. But it has all those. Yeah. LGBTQ things inside.
    I can''t remember.


    06:07:96

    [Speaker 1]: No. Okay.


    06:09:96

    [Speaker 2]: I can''t remember the name of the author. Body book is the death
    of Vivek og or something like that, sir.


    06:14:97

    [Speaker 1]: Okay. I''ve already read it. From nigerian book.


    06:17:96

    [Speaker 2]: Yes. It shocked me because me, I was thinking that, okay. The way
    it was going. Next thing I just saw that. I think he even kissed his cousin, baby.
    What? That''s where he started. That book is crazy. Last Lasher, he died. They
    killed him because, like, his friends used to warn him that he. He''s always kind
    of people that used to say, like, they want to come out as the real person that
    they are. What. What was. And I think there was, like, crisis in the. That they
    will be what? So one day he now went out during one of all those crisis. He wore
    his skirts. Lipstick, water, even. That''s how they killed him. I''m not supposed
    to be laughing. Which one? Which one? Hmm. There''s this one, I think I won''t
    told ringtongue the name of the book. I can''t remember. I don''t have the screenshot
    again that the woman was married to one guy, but the guy has a disorder that he
    cannot see anybody''s face. Like, if he looks at you, your face is just blurry.
    So it now, like the way they were writing the book, I forgot. The name of the
    book is Sha. Like, how they''re writing the book is like a diary of somebody.
    I can''t remember Sha. So the way they were writing the book, it was looking like
    it was the woman that was, like, expressing her feelings because they used to
    be so in love. But then their marriage just went south, so she now booked a trip.
    I mean, she won, like, all these. Will I say I don''t know what it was she shouted.
    Won one thing, that they gave them a vacation to one place like that. So as they
    were going, the road was bad, it was raining heavily. When they reached the place,
    it now looked like all those haunted mansions or something like that. Then every
    day, Shas, they used to stay there. Weird things used to happen. And then there
    was, there were no houses around that place, except one particular cottage. Like
    that one small cottage. And it was one old weird woman that used to live there.
    So they didn''t used to go and see her now. So apparently, after all this plenty
    drama, I think the some fish she now started seeing like, like ghosts appearing
    in the house or like somebody appearing maybe by the window or something. Now
    apparently the main person that was writing the book was that old woman that was
    in that house when that boy was young. You know, he can''t see faces now. He only
    remembered that the woman that he was working with us, his mother, was wearing
    like a red gown. And then somebody in a car hit her and then she died. That was
    how he lost his mother. So he always remembers that his more a red gown, but he
    doesn''t know who killed her. And like all those things now. So apparently the
    main person that was writing the book was his mother. No, not his mother. The
    woman that he originally married, that woman that he went for the vacation with,
    was the main person that killed his mom when he was younger. But he did not know.
    And then, like, I don''t. The story is sha confusing, because that woman that
    was now in that cottage was not like his original wife, but that woman Shah made
    it in a way that she got married to him. And here and then she now displays down.
    So when that woman found out, she now made them to come close to her, and when
    she could now torture them and all those things. The book was creepy.


    09:27:98

    [Speaker 1]: I wish you remembered the name. So I really. Sounds interesting.


    09:30:96

    [Speaker 2]: I''ll ask Ringtone.


    09:32:96

    [Speaker 1]: And then there''s a book I read of, because Kingsbury and Francis
    Rivers, they are christian authors. So like, there''s a book I read of.


    09:40:98

    [Speaker 2]: I''m not the one that writes hard songs. Abyss. No. Okay. No. Francis
    Rivers. No. He''s redeeming love.


    09:45:98

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah. Redeeming. You''re afraid.


    09:47:99

    [Speaker 2]: Yes. I''ve even watched the movie. I don''t like it. I don''t like
    any time that they make movies or books, because it never is.


    09:54:95

    [Speaker 1]: Yes. Meets the standard.


    09:56:96

    [Speaker 2]: Just. It''s just like after. Yeah.


    10:00:97

    [Speaker 1]: When I read redeeming love. Redeeming love was like the first ever
    book I read of fancy rivers and the book is big. It was long, but it was interesting
    because I think they were talking about Hosea by the Bible, but it made it sound
    very interesting and very so.


    10:18:95

    [Speaker 2]: In the Bible.


    10:21:99

    [Speaker 1]: But like, it just made it sound like human, like.


    10:24:99

    [Speaker 2]: Yes. And it was like real.


    10:27:95

    [Speaker 1]: Yes, exactly.


    10:27:95

    [Speaker 2]: How you marry somebody and then she''ll go back. After you''ve taken
    out of prostitution, she will now go back. Even sleep with your brother. Yeah,
    well, it was his brother, but.


    10:38:98

    [Speaker 1]: Then he just went back because he said, God said that. Well, if it
    was me, I don''t think I got. And the fact that he went like, he met her at first
    in like.


    10:54:98

    [Speaker 2]: Like, as he''s just so high. It was just like love at first sight.


    10:57:98

    [Speaker 1]: And then he will paid for her time. Like, he paid, like he paid for
    her time. Right? I can''t remember. I read the book a long time ago.


    11:05:98

    [Speaker 2]: Anyways, he kept on paying to see her and he was not doing anything
    with that.


    11:11:97

    [Speaker 1]: Yes, he''ll just sit down and just talk and just see. He just wants
    to talk. And then another book I read. But there''s a book that. It has like two
    series, like two parts. The first one is matters legacy. And then her mother''s
    legacy, you see. Then her daughters, fancy rivers still. And then the book was
    talking about, um, just know, like three descendants. The first one, like everything,
    it was like a cause following each other. Because like, what happens to the first
    one happens to the second. Like they were all going through the same thing they
    were going through the first time she was raped. And then her daughter now got
    raped too, when it was like it was just repeating itself. And then they never
    had, like, good relationship with their mothers. Like three of them never have
    good relationship. Very confusing. And then I used to forget some.


    12:13:00

    [Speaker 2]: Books, even me too, most times. Like, if I don''t talk about it immediately,
    I finish reading it after. Sometimes be so, like, this is just blurry.


    12:18:98

    [Speaker 1]: I can''t remember some parts, but, like, I can''t. What else? What
    other book?


    12:24:97

    [Speaker 2]: There''s one again that I read recently. What''s the name? I can''t
    remember the name. Boys. All those creepy books. Basically at the end of it is
    just showing you, like, how the devil used to, like, say, trick people into believing
    that he''s a good person. Okay, I''m trying to remember the name. Shall I read
    it last semester?


    12:44:100

    [Speaker 1]: Not read any book recently? I remember the last book I read. Yes,
    let''s talk about. Because they don''t see novels, books, constitutional law or
    something.


    12:59:95

    [Speaker 2]: I don''t think I''m busting that. So what books? What books?


    13:22:95

    [Speaker 1]: What''s your favorite book related to law?


    13:26:97

    [Speaker 2]: Criminal law. I think I like it because the. It has a lot of scenario.
    All the cases are like stories basically. So you can always remember the scene.


    13:35:97

    [Speaker 1]: Can you remember that case in the criminal law book that in the criminal
    law book that he used cutlass to and he said that it was a snake or something.
    It was his mom that he used.


    13:57:100

    [Speaker 2]: Okay. Yes. That the place was dimly dark and everything when he now
    he even cut her and body part safely and he.


    14:04:98

    [Speaker 1]: Now claimed that it was a snake. And the fact that he could just
    like Lol. And then what other story in the.


    14:18:00

    [Speaker 2]: Law books can you remember that one that he went to go and he was
    married then he now brought one woman to his house. I think he''s concubine Abi.
    What? That he even told his wife to cook for them. Then she now went to kill the
    woman in the night when she was sleeping.


    14:32:97

    [Speaker 1]: Can you remember that one? That one? I think it cause criminal law
    book too. That one? That one. That he brought his friends and each of his friends
    had their moments with her and then.


    14:49:99

    [Speaker 2]: And then he was not even charged with anything because he was married
    to her. Exactly.


    14:56:95

    [Speaker 1]: It''s not fair that case. It hurts my feelings.'

    [Speaker 2]: You are welcome.

    00:01:100


    00:02:04

    [Speaker 1]: On today''s discussion, we''ll be talking about good leadership.
    And before we dive in, I would like you to tell us what is good leadership?

    00:11:04


    00:13:99

    [Speaker 2]: Good leadership is the ability to guide, inspire and motivate others
    towards achieving a common goal. It involves effective communication, problem
    solving, decision making and vision setting. A good leader leads by example, listens
    and values the opinions of their team, and promotes a positive work culture. They
    possess strong emotional intelligence, adaptability and resilience to navigate
    through challenges and drive success.

    00:55:02



    00:56:100

    [Speaker 1]: Wow. Thank you very much. That will help us know more about good
    leadership. Now, what qualities make a good leader? Rather, Mr Motua

    01:07:02



    01:09:04

    [Speaker 2]: We have several qualities that make a good leader. If we may start
    with number one, integrity. Whereby we will say integrity is the cornerstone of
    trust in leadership. And a good leader must possess unwavering integrity to inspire
    confidence and maintain credibility. When leaders consistently uphold their values
    and principles, they set a moral compass for their teams, fostering an environment
    of honesty and dependability. Number 2, we have innovation. Innovation is virtue
    for staying competitive and driven, driving progress. Good leaders encourage innovation
    by valuing new ideas and creating creative problem solving. They recognize that
    embracing change is essential to adapt and thrive in constantly evolving world.
    Number 3, we have vision. A leader''s vision provides direction and I purpose
    for their team. It creates a shared goal that motivates and guides everyone toward
    a common objective. A leader with a clear vision can inspire and align their team''s
    efforts toward achieving ambitious goals. Number 4, passion. Passion fuels dedication
    and perseverance. Good leaders are passionate about their work and vision, which
    motivates them and inspires others to give their best. This enthusiasm can drive
    a team to overcome obstacles and achieve greatness. Number 5, we have communication.
    Effective communication is a linchpin of leadership. Leaders must articulate their
    vision, provide guidance and listen actively to their team. Strong communication
    skills ensure that messages are understood, fostering collaboration and trust.
    Number 6, we have self awareness. Self awareness. Leaders understand their strengths
    and weaknesses. This awareness enables them to make informed decision, leverage
    their strength and work on areas that need improvement. It also allows them to
    relate better to their team members. Another one is empathy at number 7, empathy
    is the ability to understand and connect with others emotionally. Good leaders
    use empathy to build rapport, resolve conflicts and create a supportive and inclusive
    work environment. It shows team members that the leaders cares about their well
    being. Number 8, we have courage. Leadership often requires making tough decisions
    and facing challenges. And on courageous, leaders are willing to take calculated
    risks, stand up for their beliefs and confront difficulties. Situation which even
    when uncomfortable. Number 9, we have delegation. Effective delegation is a mark
    of a confidence and capable leader. By entrusting tasks to team members based
    on their strengths and skills, leaders empower their team to take ownership and
    develop their abilities. This frees a leader to focus on strategic aspects of
    their role. Number 10, learning agility. In rapidly changing world, leaders must
    be quick learners. Learning agility allows leaders to adapt new information and
    circumstances, continuously improving decision making and problem solving abilities.
    Number eleven, we have adaptability. Adaptability. Leaders must adapt to involving
    situation and challenges. Those who can embrace change and adjust their strategies
    accordingly are better equipped to lead their teams through uncertainty. And ambiguity.
    12, we have decision making. In leadership, decision making isn''t just a task,
    it''s a pivotal skill. Effective leaders don''t make choices on a whim. They thoughtfully
    align each decision with their border vision and goals. They seek diverse opinion
    carefully with the pros and cons, then choose a course of action with conviction.
    This meticulous approach not only drives their objective forward, but also builds
    trust and respect among team members, reinforcing their leader''s role as trusted
    guide. Number 13, we have accountability. Accountability means taking responsibility
    for one''s action and decision. When leaders hold themselves accountable, they
    set a standard of responsibility for their team, fostering a culture of ownership
    and reliability. Number 14, we have gratitude. In a leadership role, expressing
    gratitude goes far beyond simple courtesy. It serves as an acknowledgement of
    hard work and contributions of team members. This practice not only boosts morale,
    but also strengthens interpersonal relationships and fosters a positive work environment.
    Such an unmote becomes a catalyst for motivation and productivity. Reinforcing
    the leaders role is an uplifting and empowering presence. Number 15, we have influence.
    Influence or influential leaders inspire others to follow their lead willingly.
    They lead by example, creating a shared sense of purpose and commitment within
    the team. Their influence stems from their character, action and ability to connect
    with others. And the last one, and not the least, is respect. Respect for all
    team members, regardless of their role or background, is essential for creating
    a humorous and inclusive workplace. Leaders who demonstrate respect foster a culture
    of collaboration and mutual support, enabling everyone to thrive.

    08:46:01


    08:47:04

    [Speaker 1]: Well, thank you very much for that. And on to our next question.
    How have you seen them demonstrated in your personal or professional experience?

    08:56:100


    08:58:00

    [Speaker 2]: Where I used to work, our leader would communicate on time, on making
    adjustments to schedules and budgets.

    09:08:99


    09:09:02

    [Speaker 1]: Wow. Thank you very much for that. And without wasting time, I would
    like us to proceed with the next question. Where, in your opinion, do you think
    leadership is something that can be learnt or is it an innate trait?

    09:25:02


    09:26:99

    [Speaker 2]: Leadership is an invaluable asset for any organization and it can
    be learned. Education and training provide individuals with knowledge and skills
    that can help them become effective leaders. Through education and training, individuals
    gain the ability to recognize their strengths and weaknesses.

    09:51:01


    09:51:01

    [Speaker 1]: Wow. And final, but not the last one, have you ever had a mentor
    or seen someone develop their leadership skills over time?

    10:00:02


    10:00:99

    [Speaker 2]: Yes, I once worked in a credit company and in such companies you
    need a lot of patient, agility, awareness, passion and . My mentor really lacked
    those skills due to impatient, poor communication, education and anger issues.
    But with time he has really improved. At the moment, as we speak, he is at the
    forefront to educate and create awareness in good leadership skills.

    10:40:00


    10:41:04

    [Speaker 1]: Wow. Thank you very much for your time. We are really grateful for
    that and we look forward to having you again.

    10:48:100


    10:50:05

    [Speaker 2]: Thank you so much for having me and for your time.

    [Speaker 2]: Thank you for the invite.

    00:02:02


    00:03:02

    [Speaker 1]: Today we will be discussing about Manchester United, but before we
    go further, which team do you support?

    00:08:04


    00:09:02

    [Speaker 2]: I am a Manchester United supporter.

    00:12:02


    00:12:03

    [Speaker 1]: Wow.

    00:12:99


    00:15:03

    [Speaker 2]: Yes.

    00:16:01


    00:16:99

    [Speaker 1]: Mister Ruben, could you kindly tell us more about Manchester United
    before we dive into our questions?

    00:22:01


    00:23:01

    [Speaker 2]: Okay. Manchester United is a professional football club based in
    Manchester, England. Founded in 1878, it is one of the oldest and most successful
    football clubs in the world. The team has a rich history and a large global fanbase.
    With its home ground at Old Trafford Stadium, Manchester United has won numerous
    domestic and international titles, including 20 English league titles and three
    European clubs. The club is known for its iconic red and white jersey and has
    a sport marking it on mostly renowned and prestigious football clubs in the world.

    01:07:00


    01:08:02

    [Speaker 1]: Wow. That''s very rich of Manchester United. Now, I want us to dive
    in our questions. Did you watch or did you catch Manchester United''s game last
    weekend?

    01:19:04


    01:20:00

    [Speaker 2]: Yes, I did.

    01:21:01


    01:21:04

    [Speaker 1]: And what did you think of their performance?

    01:24:00


    01:25:04

    [Speaker 2]: I watched the match between Manchester United and Liverpool. I am
    a Manchester United fan. What an entertaining match. Manchester United were playing
    at their home ground, commonly known as Old Strafford. The first half they faced
    up defeat with Liverpool taking a lead by one. The Manchester United defence was
    in shambles and they lacked possession of the ball. The possession was also in
    favour of Liverpool with a percentage of 43% and 57%, with Manchester United lacking
    a shot on target, while Liverpool enjoying a total of 15 shots and four shots
    on target. We had three offside decisions and one yellow card from Liverpool''s
    side. Two big chances wasted by Liverpool with several possessions lost by both
    teams. The second half was a much entertaining as the host Manchester United came
    from behind to a two one win up to the 84th minute when Mohamed Salah rescued
    Liverpool and the match ended in a two-two draw. The overall performance we had
    seven yellow cards, with Manchester United grabbing five yellow cards and Liverpool
    two yellow cards. We saw young players representing both teams as young as 18
    years. Kobbie Mainoo played really well and he was forced out of pitch due to
    injury on the 85th minute, Manchester United keeper Andre Onana displayed a good
    performance by saving three crucial saves against Liverpool. The man of the match
    was Bruno Fernandes, the captain of Manchester United. The players on scoresheet
    were Bruno Fernandez and Kobbie Mainoo from Manchester United, while on the other
    side of Liverpool, Luis Diaz and Mohamed Salah scored the goals.

    03:53:04


    03:54:01

    [Speaker 1]: Wow. And I''m really excited to see how Mister Mose, I''m really
    excited to see how Manchester United will do in the upcoming season. So what player
    are you most looking forward to watching on the team?

    04:09:99


    04:10:100

    [Speaker 2]: I think the team is now working hard and focusing on winning trophies.
    The goal of the team is to take the club to the next level and play in European
    Championship or competitions. I''m looking forward watching Kobbie Mainoo play
    because right now he is performing very well and is trying hard and working very
    hard to make sure that the team gets positive results. I''m also looking forward
    to see the captain, Bruno Fernandes unite players on pitch and bring the atmosphere
    of positive energy in both the pitch and dressing room. I''m also betting on Garnacho
    to improve and get more goals and work on being the top scorer on the sheet. And
    lastly, I want to see the performance of Amad Diallo who we want to see him play
    as he did on his performance while he was at loan at Sunderland. He will for sure
    be a great bet. We also want to encourage the coach, Erik ten Hag to rotate the
    squad so that we can see more positive results on the pitch.

    05:35:01


    05:35:99

    [Speaker 1]: That was very educative about Manchester United and you almost made
    me come and to shift from my team. Actually, I''ll think about that, but I''m
    so grateful for the insight, Mr. Mose.

    05:48:99


    05:49:04

    [Speaker 2]: Thank you so much for the invite.

  transcript: '00:00:00

    Speaker C: You are welcome.


    00:01:98

    [Speaker 1]: Today we will be discussing about pros of being multilingual. But
    before that, what is being multilingual?


    00:08:01

    [Speaker 2]: Multilingual refers to the ability to speak, understand, and use
    more than one language proficiently. There are numerous benefits to being multilingual
    which go beyond the practical advantages of being able to communicate with people
    from different cultural backgrounds. Some of the key pros of being multilingual
    enhanced conjunctive abilities, increased job opportunities, improved cultural
    awareness and understanding, easier travel and navigation, and the ability to
    connect with and understand others. On a deeper level, being multilingual can
    also boost overall brain function, delay the onset of degenerative disease, and
    provide a sense of confidence and worldly knowledge. Overall, being able to speak
    multiple languages can open doors, broaden perspectives, and enrich one''s personal
    and professional life in countless ways.


    01:21:02

    [Speaker 1]: Wow, thank you very much for that. And I was so impressed when I
    found out you can speak three languages fluently. What would you say are the top
    advantages of being multilingual?


    01:34:03

    [Speaker 2]: One of them includes enhanced communication skill. Compared to monolingual
    children, multilingual children are exposed to more diverse social experiences.
    As a result, multilingual children often become adapt at considering other people''s
    perspective, making them more effective communicators. Another one is high latent
    linguistic recognition. Babies are able to identify and distinguish linguistic
    sounds in the different languages used in the household before they actually are
    physically able to use the language. Research shows that monolingual babies only
    identify the single language to which they are exposed. This gives multilingual
    babies a head start on the language learning process. The more exposure the children
    receive in multiple languages, the more linguistic recognition will occur. The
    third one is superior executive functioning. Executive functioning skills are
    connective capabilities that include reasoning, planning, and problem solving.
    Studies suggest that multilingual children often have better executive functioning
    skills than their monolingual counterparts, particularly related to areas of inhibition
    monitoring. This is perhaps because of constant switching of languages in multilingual
    households. Strong executive functioning skills is significance predictor of academic
    success. The other advantage is the other advantage is increased career opportunities.
    Communicating in various languages can give multilingual applicant a clear advantage
    over monolingual applicant.


    03:45:98

    Speaker 2: In the job field.


    03:48:02

    [Speaker 2]: The international business community considers the ability to communicate
    in more than one language and in principal tool for relationship building and
    financial success. This can make it easier to find a job and also can lead to
    pay increases. Another one is attuned to their surroundings. One key advantage
    of being multilingual is the ability to continuously monitor the environment.
    Once a researcher from University of Pompeo Fabra in Spain stated, bilinguals
    have to switch languages quite often. You may have to talk to your father in one
    language and your mother in another language. It requires keeping track of changes
    around you in the same way that we monitor surroundings when driving. This applies.
    This applies to all aspects of life, whether walking down the street or playing
    sports.


    04:50:98

    Speaker 2: The other one is delay on onset dementia. Research discovered at the
    Institute of Medical Science in Hyderabad, India showed that people.


    05:02:03

    [Speaker 2]: Who spoke a second language relayed on onset of aphlazemias for 4.5
    years. This is due to the constant mental control of using multiple languages,
    which exercises the brain and helps to keep it from degenerative delaying. These
    diseases can increase quality of your life for yourself and for those around you.
    The other advantage is skilled multitaskers. Multilinguals have been shown to
    be better multitaskers because of the ability to switch languages. According to
    researches in the United States news article, when a bilingual speaks two languages,
    regularly speaking in just one of these languages requires use of the control
    network to limit interference from the other language and to ensure the continued
    dominance of the intended language. The other advantage is multiple languages
    multiplies perspectives. As they learn new language, people often adopt new preferences
    and perspectives. Researchers have even explained have even examined.


    06:17:98

    Speaker 2: The way in which languages produce a language mindset defined as feeling
    like a.


    06:24:01

    [Speaker 2]: Different person when using different languages. This may be as a
    result of varying grammar and structures of language. The other advantage is it
    improves memory.


    06:37:01

    Speaker C: It improves memory.


    06:37:01

    [Speaker 2]: Memory plays a huge part in learning language. Those who are multilingual
    often score higher in memory test than those who only use one language. Having
    a great memory can have both conjective and social benefits like recognizing faces
    or remember membering names. The last and the least is increased ability to learn
    additional languages. A recent study found that compared to people who are fluent
    in only one language, multilingual individuals have an easier time.


    07:10:99

    Speaker 2: Picking up a new language.


    07:12:98

    [Speaker 2]: In fact, the acquisition of multiple languages can help with the
    process of learning.


    07:20:00

    Speaker 2: New language as well as improve competency in native language.


    07:25:01

    [Speaker 2]: This is because languages reinforce one another and provide tools
    to strengthen phonological, morphologic and synthetic skill.


    07:39:00

    [Speaker 1]: Wow, thank you for that. And I''ve always wanted to learn another
    language, but I''m not sure if it''s worth the effort. As someone who is multilingual,
    what benefits have you experienced from knowing multiple languages.


    07:52:02

    Speaker 2: Learning more languages helps in expanding your mind and worldview.
    When you learn a new language, you also learn the culture of the people who speak
    it. You get a deep awareness of the world outside of your bumble and you can see
    the world from other people''s perspective. This is good for a couple of reasons.
    One, you develop professionally. Two, you develop personally. If you develop professionally.
    The modern workplace is multicultural. Tolerance and empathy are key. Learning
    a language boosts those characteristics and makes you an in demand employee when
    you develop personally. Sure, you could go through life never thinking beyond
    the borders of your hometown. Lot of people do this and preferably and perfectly
    are happy. But if you are a lifelong learner who isn''t satisfied with staying
    the same, learning a language broadens your horizon. So what do you think? With
    your expanded mind and worldview, you get out and meet new people. For every language
    you speak, you have a whole. You have a who. You have a whole worldview. You get
    out there and meet new people. For every language you speak, you have a whole
    bunch of new people to communicate with. So when you are multilingual person who
    speaks more than two languages frequently, you''ve got unlimited opportunities
    to interact with people from all over the world. It also helps you to give you
    a meaningful experience in your local community and overseas. Many of us who live
    in multicultural places, there are some people from all over the world living
    in our doorstep. Being fluent in multiple languages helps you to make connection
    in these different communities. It''s the same when you are traveling. You go
    oversea and only use English. It''s easy and you''ll have a good time, but any
    interactions you have are superficial by default. But if you know multiple languages,
    you have meaningful conversation. When people all over the world travel experiences
    become deeper and more meaningful than ever, all by speaking same languages as
    locals. It also helps you to find a romantic partner. Here are less obvious benefits.
    Getting a learning or a language can help you find a romantic partner. According
    to some of many surveys. They always say like that. This also increases your social
    skills. People who speak multiple languages are more empathetic and can consider
    other people''s points of view. They understand that other people''s beliefs,
    values and opinions are different from theirs and they are accepting of those
    differences. This improved perspective taking means multilinguals have better
    social skills. Language is social. It''s a tool for communicating with other people.
    That''s why people who learn multiple languages from an early age have better
    social skills. They are great at monitoring who is saying what and in what language
    and they can support social partners more easily than monolingual people. It also
    reduces the risk of mental decline. Conjunctive decline is a huge health issue
    in the United States. Women have a 37% risk dementia. They always there are ways
    to delay this, however, one of the best speaking multilingual languages. Another
    way is it also improves your memory. It also helps you to broaden your mind. And
    obviously you need to remember a lot to be a fluent language. And memory training
    spreads to other parts of your life. You will be less likely to forget birthdays
    and appointments, and you will always know when you left the keys and where you
    left them. Learning more languages becomes easy. When you learn more languages,
    it also makes your life to be more easy. It also increases your employability.
    People with language skills are in high demand. Modern businesses operate in multicultural
    or international settings. People who can speak multilingual languages are extremely
    valuable to them. Add your language skills to your resume and watch your employability
    show. It opens exciting doors and interesting job opportunities. It helps these
    in the following ways. You can get a job with diplomats or diplomatic job. You
    can get a job like a translator. You can also get a job as an interpreter. Having
    or speaking more different languages is healthy and makes you grow better. For
    that said, I can only say that multilingual is better than monolingual.


    13:39:01

    [Speaker 1]: Thank you very much Mr. Kevin for the insight.

  transcript: "00:00:99\n[Speaker 1]: All right, so today's topic is child marriage.\n\
    00:05:00\n\n00:06:00\n[Speaker 2]: Yo, that's a toughie.\n00:07:97\n\n00:08:00\n\
    [Speaker 1]: That's a tough one. Yeah. So child marriage, it was described as\
    \ a harmful practice that refers to any formal marriage. Right. Or informal union\
    \ between a child under the ages of 18 and an adult or another child, you know.\
    \ So this is basically a forced marriage...\n00:39:02\n\n00:39:02\n[Speaker 2]:\
    \ it is \n00:40:02\n\n00:40:02\n[Speaker 1]: Yeah. If you come to think of it,\
    \ because a child under the age of 18, they are still developing. Now, how can\
    \ you take that infant and throw them to an adult in a marriage? I mean, marriage\
    \ is a very hard task. It's very hard itself.\n01:05:100\n\n01:06:99\n[Speaker\
    \ 2]: Imagine being a child having to, like, do those tasks. \n01:12:03\n\n01:12:03\n\
    [Speaker 1]: Imagine\n01:13:01\n\n01:13:01\n[Speaker 2]: ...that old women can't\
    \ even obtain.\n01:15:99\n\n01:16:01\n[Speaker 1]: No, they can't. You know, they\
    \ can't. So I feel that it's child abuse, but however, it's actually being practiced\
    \ in other cultures. So in other people, it's a culture, you know, whereby you\
    \ get a child, a girl child at the ages of maybe 10, 12, 14, being married to\
    \ an old man.\n01:52:97\n\n01:53:01\n[Speaker 2]:  Older than their father\n01:54:98\n\
    \n01:54:98\n[Speaker 1]: Older than their fathers, their grandfathers. I actually\
    \ came across this video On Facebook where a granny married a child.\n02:11:100\n\
    \n\n02:13:03\n[Speaker 2]: How is that even possible? who does that?\n02:16:01\n\
    \n02:14:100\n[Speaker 1]: Married a child, a seven year old boy. I don't know\
    \ if I still have that picture, but I took a screenshot of it. I was so moved,\
    \ you know, I was so moved. I was so emotional. Like, you know, it goes back to\
    \ that issue of naming children with dead people. You know, other. Other people\
    \ name their kids by maybe their dead grandmother, dead grandfather, whoever.\
    \ Now it destroys them, I feel that.\n02:55:02\n\n02:55:02\n[Speaker 2]:  Yeah,\
    \ those kids must be going through a lot.\n02:57:97\n\n02:57:99\n[Speaker 1]:\
    \ They are.\n02:58:97\n\n02:59:97\n[Speaker 2]: Imagine at the age of 10 to 18,\
    \ you must still be playing\n03:05:97\n\n03:06:01\n[Speaker 1]: You must still\
    \ be playing \n03:07:98\n\n03:08:02\n[Speaker 2]: with toys.\n03:08:100\n\n03:09:98\n\
    [Speaker 1]: You know, \n03:09:98\n\n03:10:99\n[Speaker 2]: getting, like, jumping\
    \ muddy puddles.\n03:13:03\n\n03:13:99\n[Speaker 1]: Trying to find yourself.\n\
    03:15:02\n\n03:15:98\n[Speaker 2]: Yes, but being a wife or a husband at that\
    \ age.\n03:20:00\n\n03:19:01\n[Speaker 1]: At that age, wow!\n03:21:02\n\n03:21:00\n\
    [Speaker 2]:  That must be terrifying. \n03:22:01\n\n03:22:97\n[Speaker 1]:  Its\
    \ very terrifying, it's Terrible.  You know, so I really do not agree with this\
    \ but it's happening in some cultures, so whether we like it or not, it's happening.\
    \ But then I would say that child marriage, it's an abuse to kids.\n03:39:01\n\
    \n03:39:02\n[Speaker 2]: It is.\n03:40:99\n\n03:41:01\n[Speaker 1]: It's an abuse.\
    \ You know, as you said, that, you know, a. A 16 year old, a teenager, like, let's\
    \ just take a teenager for this instance. Those guys are still trying to find\
    \ themselves.\n03:57:98\n\n03:57:01\n[Speaker 2]: Themselves, Yes.\n03:59:03\n\
    \n03:59:03\n[Speaker 1]: Teenagers don't know anything about themselves. Hence\
    \ we have so many sections, you know, about teenagers. Everywhere we go, we have\
    \ books. We have books to help us raise teenagers. We have programs that we sign\
    \ into to raise teenagers. You know, we do not get along with our teenage children.\
    \ So imagine that kind of a child being placed in a marriage, you know, even if\
    \ it's not a child and an adult, sometimes you find that it's actually two kids.\n\
    04:40:100\n\n04:40:100\n[Speaker 2]: Yes.\n04:41:98\n\n04:42:98\n[Speaker 1]:\
    \ You being married, maybe this one is twelve, that one is six.\n04:46:02\n\n\
    04:47:00\n[Speaker 2]: What happened to getting married because you love each\
    \ other.\n04:50:100\n\n04:51:100\n[Speaker 1]: Hence, I'm saying that sometimes,\
    \ it is the culture\n04:55:00\n\n04:54:03\n[Speaker 2]: Dont you think  that,\
    \ when you're talking about the culture, don't you think it's because of poverty\
    \ and stuff.\n05:05:00\n\n05:07:03\n[Speaker 1]: You know In indian culture, we've\
    \ see. Have you not seen it in indian cultures? Mostly \n05:13:99\n\n05:13:99\n\
    [Speaker 2]: I have, \n05:15:03\n\n05:15:03\n[Speaker 1]: Yes. And you find that\
    \ even the bride or the groom, they are unhappy. \n05:19:00\n\n\n05:20:00\n[Speaker\
    \ 2]: Always \n05:20:98\n\n05:20:99\n[Speaker 1]: They are unhappy. \n05:22:01\n\
    \n05:21:100\n[Speaker 2]:They are always unhappy\n05:23:01\n\n\n05:23:01\n[Speaker\
    \ 1]: And you find that maybe the girl's parents, the mother's not happy, she\
    \ keeps crying. And the father is just there being bold and saying, you're gonna\
    \ do this. You're gonna do this.\n05:35:01\n\n05:36:99\n[Speaker 2]: So do you\
    \ think it's because of poverty or.\n05:39:02\n\n05:41:99\n[Speaker 1]: That kind\
    \ of culture? I believe that it's poverty. I mean, you can. You cannot send your\
    \ child to something that you know, that he or she will never handle. I feel that\
    \ it's because of poverty. Parents sell their kids. Well, that's my opinion. You\
    \ know?  that's my opinion. I feel that parents sell kids for poverty.\n06:06:03\n\
    \n06:07:97\n[Speaker 2]: Or maybe they're just looking out for their children\
    \ to get a better future or I don't know.\n06:13:98\n\n06:13:98\n[Speaker 1]:\
    \ And you find that most of the time, even if that's the case, of maybe assisting\
    \ your kid to get the privileges of a good life, those people, they are so abusive.\
    \ The rich people are so abusive. They will abuse your kids until your child dies\
    \ or maybe comes to you crying. \n06:33:02\n\n06:33:02\n[Speaker 2]: That's bad\n\
    06:34:97\n\n06:34:97\n[Speaker 1]: It's very bad.\n06:36:03\n\n06:36:03\n[Speaker\
    \ 2]: The worst part is they cannot even go back home.\n06:37:99\n\n06:38:02\n\
    [Speaker 1]: No, they cannot. I do not agree with that I'm telling you.\n06:44:98"

  transcript: '00:00:00

    [Speaker 1]: Alright, so today''s topic is bo bo bo. Okay. Um, peer pressure in
    adolescence. Now, I feel that we have had this conversation for, like, forever.
    Yes. Because we, we all went through this stage. Yeah, we went through this stage
    of peer pressure. And so I don''t know if you''d like to share something with
    us regarding this topic.


    00:41:04

    [Speaker 2]: I''d say that peer pressure is a huge influence on adolescents as
    they navigate the challenges of growing up and forming their identities.


    00:56:98

    [Speaker 1]: Yes. Yes.


    00:56:98

    [Speaker 2]: Right.


    00:59:02

    [Speaker 1]: They actually, in a. They''re actually looking for themselves.


    01:04:98

    [Speaker 2]: Yes.


    01:04:98

    [Speaker 1]: In that stage, they do not really.


    01:07:02

    [Speaker 2]: Know who they are or what they are doing.


    01:11:04

    [Speaker 1]: Like me, as, as a young MPO, like, I''m like, who am I? I''m actually
    in that stage, you know, where I ask myself, who am I? What do I want? What do
    I want? Yes. So I do, uh, believe that it also refers to the impact that teenagers
    who are of similar age or age group and interest have on individual thoughts,
    behaviors and decision making processes, you know? So adolescents often face peer
    pressure in various forms, both positive and negative, you know, as they seek
    acceptance and approval from their social circles.


    02:03:03

    [Speaker 2]: Wait, a positive peer influence?


    02:08:99

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah, we have two types of peer influence. You know, we have negative
    peer influence and also positive, you know, so I''ve.


    02:21:03

    [Speaker 2]: Never heard of the positive one.


    02:23:03

    [Speaker 1]: Really? You''ve only heard. Okay, you know, positive peer influence,
    it can serve a positive role model for teenagers or idolizers. Okay. Yes. Encouraging
    them to excel academically, you know, participating in activities and develop
    essential social skills. We do have those kind of people, you know, it doesn''t
    mean that when you are a teenager, you''re always thinking of negative stuff.
    We do have people who are raised properly. Not to say that the ones who have negative
    impact, who have the negative peer influence were not raised properly. I mean,
    in this world, we choose who we wanna be.


    03:14:02

    [Speaker 2]: Yeah.


    03:14:02

    [Speaker 1]: You know, so positive peer relationships can foster friendships,
    you know, provide emotional support and inspire personal growth.


    03:28:98

    [Speaker 2]: Oh, so that''s what it is.


    03:30:02

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah, that''s what it is. Basically. Lies. Yeah. Would you also like
    to know about the negative peer influences? Please lead teenagers to encourage
    I. Or to engage in risky behaviors such as some substance abuse, you know, or
    early sexual activities. Yeah. That we have seen. And I really do not understand.
    Why do we have. Why does it contribute, why the negative peer influence contributes
    a lot more than the positive peer influence?


    04:12:01

    [Speaker 2]: Not to think it''s because teenagers are trying to find themselves.


    04:18:99

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah.


    04:18:99

    [Speaker 2]: They''re not really mentally stable, I''d say.


    04:23:01

    [Speaker 1]: Because they are still developing.


    04:25:01

    [Speaker 2]: Yes.


    04:25:01

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah, I would say. I would say that. And one other thing, I would
    actually say maybe the climate change or maybe the world evolving and stuff because
    they do have an impact on us as human beings. Really? Yeah, that''s what I didn''t
    think so. You know, negative influencers from other peers may push individuals
    to actually confront or conform to, you know, to harmful norms, like making choices
    that go against their values, you know?


    05:08:01

    [Speaker 2]: Sure, that''s bad.


    05:08:01

    [Speaker 1]: It''s very bad. But what I like about this, this topic of ours, it
    doesn''t necessarily support only one side.


    05:21:00

    [Speaker 2]: It supports both sides.


    05:21:00

    [Speaker 1]: Both sides. We understand that there are two sides of peer pressure
    sense in the world. It''s not actually one thing because hence I was saying this,
    we only see bad things that teenagers do.


    05:43:01

    [Speaker 2]: That''s. I think that''s because teenagers often do those bad things
    more than good things.


    05:51:02

    [Speaker 1]: I don''t know. I don''t know. But then, you know what? I''ll just
    trust you there. But we do have teenagers, but they are there, you know? So I
    also feel that we should. We as parents, as the society, we should support our
    teenage children, you know, we should support them in order that. In order that
    they make better decisions in life.


    06:23:00

    [Speaker 2]: Meaning that''s a positive influence.


    06:26:03

    [Speaker 1]: That''s a positive influence, you know? Yes, but you know what? I
    remember when I used to be a teenager because believe me, I''ve been. Been there.
    Even though I am, I am an adult. I''ve been there. But whatever. What I see, what
    I see, the teen, our, today''s teenagers are actually not like us in our days
    when we were teenagers.


    06:57:02

    [Speaker 2]: How is that?


    06:57:02

    [Speaker 1]: It''s totally two different generation, you know?


    07:03:03

    [Speaker 2]: Okay, would you like to elaborate?


    07:03:03

    [Speaker 1]: Yes. We did have a peer pressure in our days, but it wasn''t as strong
    as what we see these days. I mean, in our times, the peer pressure that we had,
    it was about, you know, being your favorite mom, being your. Sorry. Being your
    favorite child amongst your siblings and stuff. You know, it wasn''t all about
    the influence outside, really. Yes, it wasn''t. It wasn''t all about the influence
    outside. It started in the house. Everything started in the house. I wanted to
    be better than everyone else, than my sister, to my mother, you know? But in today''s.
    In today''s world, teenagers have peer pressure. Like, it''s very strong these
    days. You know, they compete, especially with friends, also with celebrities,
    with friends and stuff.


    08:14:04

    [Speaker 2]: So it''s not only at home.


    08:14:04

    [Speaker 1]: It''s not only at home.


    08:17:02

    [Speaker 2]: It''s always from the outside, actually.


    08:19:100

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah. With friends or classmates, you know, teammates maybe. When
    you take part in sports at school, whatever social trends, you know, that is the
    most dangerous one, because I see today''s kids, when they see something on the
    Internet, they want to try.


    08:44:03

    [Speaker 2]: It, which is not always a good thing.


    08:47:04

    [Speaker 1]: It isn''t. They want to try it, and they want it to work for them.


    08:50:99

    [Speaker 2]: They try so hard.


    08:50:99

    [Speaker 1]: They try so hard, and it''s damaging. It''s damaging. It''s a very
    negative influence on them, you know?


    09:04:04

    [Speaker 2]: Do you think role models often play a positive or a negative influence?


    09:10:01

    [Speaker 1]: Role models?


    09:10:01

    [Speaker 2]: Yes. From teenagers.


    09:14:03

    [Speaker 1]: From teenagers. I actually feel that it depends on the celebrity.
    No, sorry, the role model. Because we do not conduct ourselves the same. You know,
    we do have. For an example, we do have celebrities. Some of them you can actually
    learn from. Some of them you cannot learn from. You understand? So I feel. Yeah,
    I feel that it goes both ways. We do have role models that we can look up to,
    you know? So is there anything that you''d maybe like to share from your teenage
    perspective?


    09:59:98

    [Speaker 2]: No.


    10:01:99

    [Speaker 1]: You don''t want to share anything. How about my school life?


    10:05:02

    [Speaker 2]: Yo, my school life was a hell.


    10:08:01

    [Speaker 1]: What. What happened Filas there for?


    10:15:00

    [Speaker 2]: It was bad.


    10:15:00

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah.


    10:15:00

    [Speaker 2]: I mean, I was always that quiet kid at school, you know, so, like,
    I wasn''t trying so hard to fit.


    10:27:02

    [Speaker 1]: In, but I think it''s a positive one.


    10:30:100

    [Speaker 2]: Okay.


    10:30:100

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah. It is a positive peer pressure. It is a positive sign, because
    trying to fit in actually takes you to stages where you risk your life in order
    for you to fit in, you know? Yeah. You find that maybe at school there was this
    group of ladies they. Yeah. You see? So I feel that they had their signatures
    where they did whatever they did. Maybe they went to parties, they had drugs,
    they took their drugs, they took alcohol. They took part in sexual activities
    at a young age.


    11:17:01

    [Speaker 2]: It''s always the popular girls.


    11:17:01

    [Speaker 1]: It''s always the popular girls.


    11:20:02

    [Speaker 2]: Always.


    11:20:02

    [Speaker 1]: Whoa. You know what? I''ve just remembered something. I''ve just
    remembered something from my teenage days when I used to attend my high school.
    So there was this lady who, in the same class, she had her friends. I mean, I
    wasn''t in their league. I won''t lie to you. I was not in their league. So they
    would always go out for parties on weekends. They would wear short skirts. Not
    to say that girls with short skirts have bad intentions or whatever, I''m just
    saying, like, that was their signature. They used to wear very short skirts. They
    used to prepare their hair. Their hair was up to date. They would wear makeup
    and in, nowadays, you wouldn''t wear makeup, but they would wear makeup, you know,
    meaning they were popular. They were popular, you know. And I had this friend
    of mine who wanted to. She knew the other lady from the group. From that group.
    So that lady, my friend, wanted us to join them. And because I wasn''t that big
    of a. I was also not seeking for popularity or whatever. Yeah. Acceptance from
    others, as I told you that. You know what? I used to have that pressure at home,
    you know, I wanna be better. I wanna be better more than my sister. I wanna do
    my chores. And my mom, when she comes from work, I wanna show her mom, this is
    what I did. This is what I did, you know? Yeah, that''s it. That. That was the
    only acceptance, I don''t wanna lie, that I wanted, you know, in those age.


    13:09:03

    [Speaker 2]: Yeah.


    13:09:03

    [Speaker 1]: So you know what? My friend joined them.


    13:14:98

    [Speaker 2]: Were you guys friends after that?


    13:17:00

    [Speaker 1]: No, we were, like, speaking to each other and that was it. We were
    never friends anymore. Because she got consumed and they were expelled at school.
    They were expelled because they were rebellious. They didn''t do their schoolwork.
    They used to backchat at teachers. After she joined the group, she would backchat.
    She was back chatting, and then she took herself, like, she distanced herself,
    herself from me. And I heard that she was here and I heard that. I heard that
    she started drinking alcohol age, and she actually got fell pregnant. You know,
    that''s tough. If I can see, if you can see her today, you''ll never agree that.
    I''ll show you a picture of her when you were in high school. You will never agree
    that that is actually her. So she got caught in the negative influence, peer pressure
    influence. But when we were together, I wouldn''t want to lie. We used to have
    that positive influence towards each other of doing our schoolwork and doing our
    chores. Yes. So, yeah, it''s a.'

  transcript: '00:00:97

    [Speaker 1]: Alright, so today''s topic is friendship. So I feel that it''s a
    very beautiful topic, or rather conversation.

    00:12:00


    00:12:02

    [Speaker 2]: What''s your view on friendship?

    00:15:02


    00:16:00

    [Speaker 1]: My view on friendship? All right. Firstly, when we talk about friendship,
    to me, we are actually talking about something beautiful, something pure, you
    know, something, something out of this world, you know, because to me, a friendship
    is a very beautiful relationship going on between two people.

    00:46:99


    00:47:100

    [Speaker 2]: It can''t be like more than two people, like a group.

    00:50:97


    00:51:02

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah. Yes, yes, you''re correct. So a friendship is a relationship
    of mutual affection, you know, between people that goes beyond, mere association.
    So it''s not about just meeting, you know, it''s deeper than that. It''s deeper
    than that, yes. It''s not about you guys meeting maybe for, for rugby club meeting,
    you know, or anything like that, or family meetings. Like when you meet, my God,
    it''s. You go like, it''s something beautiful, my guys. So I feel that it represents
    a very strong interpersonal bond where people choose to be with one another, you
    know, where they''re choosing to enjoy spending time together. Yes. And providing
    positive and supportive roles for one another you know.

    01:57:98


    01:58:99

    [Speaker 2]: And common features that are known for friendships are trust.

    02:04:99


    02:05:97

    [Speaker 1]: Yes.

    02:05:99


    02:06:03

    [Speaker 2]: Shared values most of the time, like keeping in each other like company
    and like supporting one another, you know, the enjoyment of people being around
    each other.

    02:19:98


    02:19:99

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah. You know? Yeah. But I feel that we have too many different
    friendships, wouldn''t you agree? Because I used to have a childhood friend, you
    know, I used to have childhood, in fact, childhood friends, which now we are,
    we actually do not interact anymore, but we''re not friends anymore. But at the
    same time, we do not have bad blood to, between each other. Yes. When we meet,
    when we meet maybe in the malls or wherever, we get excited, you know, to see
    each other. We remember that bond that we used to have as children, you know.
    So I feel that friendship has too many stages and then I feel that it also has
    the adolescent stage, you know, where teenager. Yeah, where teenager becomes more
    giving, you know, sharing more, being frank and yes, and very special, you know,
    because I feel that teenagers rely on, rely very heavy, heavily on their friendship,
    on their, yes, yeah, you know, and companionship as they navigate, as they navigate
    the challenges in the developmental stage. So friendship in adolescence plays
    a very crucial role in shaping social skills, you know.

    04:09:99


    04:10:99

    [Speaker 2]: Emotional well being, and self identity.

    04:15:01


    04:15:01

    [Speaker 1]: Yes, yes. You know, so a friendship is a very beautiful thing. It''s
    a very beautiful thing. People sharing really beautiful emotions and memories.
    But how do you feel about a child being a friend with their parents? Is it possible?

    04:35:99


    04:36:01

    [Speaker 2]: Yeah, it is possible. It is a good thing because. Because most of
    the time, just because they are your parents, you get scared of them. Like, you
    should have, like, some bond that you should not, like, disrespect them, but disrespect,
    but respect them still having not to be scared and yeah, having fun.

    05:00:99


    05:00:99

    [Speaker 1]: Yes. So I also read somewhere about child and parent friendship,
    that as parents, you shouldn''t be friends with your kids. You know, a lady once
    told me that, you know what? You shouldn''t be friends with your kids because
    they, they get too, too comfortable with, with you guys.

    05:29:98


    05:30:01

    [Speaker 2]: That''s why I said you must have some level of respect.

    05:33:98


    05:33:99

    [Speaker 1]: Yes.

    05:34:00


    05:35:03

    [Speaker 2]: But not, like, being scared, because, like, most people ask you their
    parents.

    05:38:99


    05:39:01

    [Speaker 1]: Yes. So you''re saying that you should be friends, but you should
    have limits.

    05:45:03


    05:44:98

    [Speaker 2]: Limits, yes.

    05:45:01


    05:46:02

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah. Yeah. I do agree with.

    05:47:100


    05:48:00

    [Speaker 2]: It''s like, It''s like when you''re having a mutual friend, like,
    yeah, your friend. Your friend has a friend, like, you are not that tapped in,
    but we have to, like, always. You have. You always meet each other? Some things
    like that.

    06:03:98


    06:03:100

    [Speaker 1]: Yes.

    06:04:01


    06:04:02

    [Speaker 2]: So obviously, you''re not gonna tell him or her everything. She''s
    not gonna. She or he''s not gonna tell you everything.

    06:11:98


    06:11:99

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah.

    06:12:00


    06:12:01

    [Speaker 2]: You have some level of respect that you don''t know this person.

    06:15:01


    06:16:02

    [Speaker 1]: Yes.

    06:16:98


    06:17:01

    [Speaker 2]: So you don''t really, like, open up that too, that much.

    06:22:99


    06:23:01

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah. No, I do agree with you. And, , I also feel that. Yeah, and
    I also feel that it''s a great thing as a parent to be, to become friends with
    your kids because I feel that you would understand them better.

    06:41:100


    06:43:03

    [Speaker 2]: Yes.

    06:42:99


    06:43:01

    [Speaker 1]: You know, you would understand all their emotions and stuff.

    06:47:97


    06:47:98

    [Speaker 2]: And you''ll be more free to, like, open up to your parents for some
    things happening, like maybe at school getting bullied. Sometimes you don''t tell
    your parents, but, like, having that friendship and that trust you build up on,
    you can tell them openly.

    07:04:97


    07:04:98

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah.

    07:05:00


    07:06:01

    [Speaker 2]: You can open up to them. You become open. You become open, you know,
    which is a good thing.

    07:11:97


    07:11:98

    [Speaker 1]: Which is a good thing, because in that way, you guys, you will be
    able to, to control every situation that your child comes in their way. No, that''s
    a very nice, that''s a very nice point to get there. So, you know, there are a
    lot of things going on in friendships, you know, not always positive stuff. Not
    always. We don''t have positive effects in friendships. Only we do have negative
    effects.

    07:52:03


    07:51:98

    [Speaker 2]: Yes.

    07:52:00


    07:52:01

    [Speaker 1]: You know, like a friendship. I feel that a good friendship can be
    destroyed by two friends lending each other money. You know, money has always
    been the root of the problem between everyone. Not only in friendship, also in
    families, also at work places and everywhere, you know

    08:19:01



    08:19:98

    [Speaker 2]: Gotta be two sided, not one sided.

    08:21:98


    08:21:100

    [Speaker 1]: Yes, yes, and also, like, now we actually looking at the negative
    effect on friendships. Hey, now you find that you, my friend, and you''ve just
    opened up your shop, you know, so whenever I don''t have the cash to buy whatever
    I need, I just go to your shop thinking that you will give me. Yeah. For free
    or maybe on credit and stuff. And you find out that the laws that you put it at
    your store doesn''t allow anyone to take credit or give. People don''t understand
    that when you give stuff to people that you should be selling to others, they
    are actually destroying you. Exactly, you know.

    09:14:02


    09:14:03

    [Speaker 2]: So friendship and friendships, some, some friendships end like that
    because you think it''s one sided.

    09:20:02


    09:19:99

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah.

    09:20:02

    [Speaker 2]: Like, because the person cannot give you everything. Like, sometimes
    you gotta count on yourself too.

    09:25:100


    09:26:02

    [Speaker 1]: Yes. No, you''re correct. So, yeah, but friendship is a very beautiful
    affection, you know, between people and I still say that I really love friendships.
    You know, they come up. It''s a beautiful name and even when you say friendship,
    or maybe when your, when your friend call you and when you pick up the phone,
    she''s like, or, he''s like, but when she''s a girl, she''s like, hi, friend and
    you''re like, hi, friend, how are you? You know, it''s a beautiful. Yeah, that
    happiness, you, it gives you some kind of peace. You know, there are some certain
    stuff that you can actually tell them that you''re not able. Yes, that you can''t
    tell anyone. And you guys will be like, yo, bro, what up, bro? Where have you
    been, bro? And stuff.

  transcript: "00:01:99\n[Speaker 2]: I'm so much humbled to be with you on board\
    \ today.\n00:04:97\n\n00:04:97\n[Speaker 1]: Okay, today we are discussing about\
    \ teenage pregnancy. Kindly let us know what is teenage pregnancy?\n00:14:97\n\
    \n00:14:97\n[Speaker 2]: Thank you very much and I will give a brief of what is\
    \ teenage pregnancy? According to my understanding now, teenage pregnancy refers\
    \ to the situation in which a girl aged between 13 and 19 becomes pregnant. It\
    \ is a global issue that affects not only the pregnant girl but also her family\
    \ as well as the community. Teenage pregnancy can have negative consequences for\
    \ both the mother and child, including health risks, socio stigmatization and\
    \ barrier to education and employment opportunities. Addressing this issue requires\
    \ comprehensive sex education, access to reproductive healthcare and support for\
    \ young parents.\n01:05:96\n\n01:07:97\n[Speaker 1]: Wow. Thank you for that brief\
    \ explanation. And to our first question, did you hear about the recent rise in\
    \ teenage pregnancies?\n01:16:97\n\n01:16:97\n[Speaker 2]: Yes, and that made\
    \ me feel so heartbroken.\n01:20:97\n\n01:22:95\n[Speaker 1]: What do you think\
    \ could be the reason behind it? \n01:25:99\n\n01:27:99\n[Speaker 2]: Now some\
    \ of the causes of the high rise of the teenage pregnancy when we have school\
    \ dropouts, pregnant girls often drop out of schools, limiting opportunities for\
    \ future employment and perpetuating the cycle of poverty. Now we also have married\
    \ adolescents. In this case, adolescent pregnancy can also have negative social\
    \ and economic effects on girls. Their families and communities will be affected\
    \ by this. We have socioeconomics, in this case for girls aged 15 to 19 years\
    \ old, risks are associated with more socioeconomic factors that with the biological\
    \ effects of age. These factors are critical in fully understanding teenage pregnancy\
    \ and for promotion of reproductive health among the adolescents. We also have\
    \ educational attainment, poor educational background, living non relatives, risky\
    \ sexual behaviors, perceived support from parents, poor knowledge of sexuality\
    \ are risk factors to considering high rises of teenage pregnancy. We also have\
    \ media exposure. It is important to note that media exposure is a complex issue\
    \ also in Nigeria and can have both positive and negative impacts on adolescents.\
    \ Or we have other family members. In this case, teen pregnancy and motherhood\
    \ can influence younger siblings. One study found that the younger sister of a\
    \ teen mother are highly we can say that are highly exposed to becoming pregnant\
    \ because they'll follow the suit of what the sister went through. We have parental\
    \ support in this case. It is important to note that parental support can play\
    \ a protective role in reducing adolescent pregnancy. So if a parent does not\
    \ support their children, they will be exposed to what to most of what is going\
    \ on, rather causing teenage pregnancy. We also have peer pressure, peer pressure\
    \ and media influence. Aside from sexual or rather, sexual related abuse studies\
    \ have reported that peer pressure is a significant factor influencing adolescent\
    \ pregnancy, more so in the parts of Nigeria. We also have sexual violence. Early\
    \ sexual debut and being out of school are significantly associated with teenage\
    \ pregnancies. Desire to compensate for the loss of a child, reduced access to\
    \ information and contraception, and increased sexual violence. This really rather\
    \ increases the high rise of teenage pregnancies. We have lack of sex education.\
    \ Those who have received minimal education are five times more likely to become\
    \ a mother than those with higher levels of education. We have lack of contraceptions,\
    \ lack of reproductive health education, lack of parental control, family and\
    \ peer pressure, poverty, love for material goods, misinformation and also lack\
    \ of individual agency. Poverty, school dropout, lack of community support and\
    \ limited access to contraception rather are some of the high causes of teenage\
    \ pregnancies. We have poverty. Poverty. Besides the lack of contraceptives, adolescent\
    \ pregnancies are also fueled by poverty. A poverty and dysfunctional family are\
    \ implicated as influencing adolescent pregnancy. More so in Ghana, we have alcohol\
    \ or drug use. In this case, inhibition reducing drugs and alcohol may possibly\
    \ encourage unintended sexual activity causing teenage pregnancies. We also have\
    \ early puberty alleviate. In this case, girls who mature early are more likely\
    \ to engage in sexual intercourse at a younger age and this will end up causing\
    \ high rise in teenage pregnancies.\n06:19:95\n\n06:21:100\n[Speaker 1]: Wow.\
    \ Thank you for that information. Number two, I read an article about the challenges\
    \ that teen teenage mothers rather face. Have you or anyone you know experienced\
    \ similar struggles as a young parent?\n06:41:95\n\n06:42:98\n[Speaker 2]: Yes,\
    \ someone very close indeed faced some of the struggles and I would like to highlight\
    \ some of the struggles that I've seen teenage mothers go through. If you kindly\
    \ allow me Mister Francis. Challenge number one, we have changes to mental health.\
    \ Both becoming a teenage and pregnant are among the risk factors for depression.\
    \ When these two factors are combined, the risk increases. Only ten to 15% of\
    \ older mother experience prenatal and postpartum. This is after delivery depression\
    \ and there are several causes for mental health changes in teenage mothers. One\
    \ reason is that teen moms are more likely to experience pregnancy complications\
    \ and this added rather adds stress to the teen mother. Teen parents do not have\
    \ the time to devote to exercise, sleep and self care that they may have had before\
    \ giving birth. Another challenge we have is the cost of raising a child. Infant\
    \ care comes with large costs as we all know about time involved in feeding a\
    \ baby takes a lot and consumes a lot. It's important to know the financial investment\
    \ involved as well. If you use formula, for example, you'll have to budget for\
    \ this expense. Baby food, which most children begin at six months, is another\
    \ cost to consider. New moms have bottles, diapers, clothes, and toys to consider.\
    \ In addition to healthcare costs, an infant requires larger ticket items such\
    \ as a crib, high chair, changing table, and a stroller. We also have another\
    \ challenge is difficulty juggling school with a child. School, as we all know,\
    \ is time consuming. High school students in most schools, they spend roughly\
    \ 7 hours a day. Even more high school teachers nationwide assign three, let's\
    \ say 3.5 hours of work, that is, assignments on average. That means that students\
    \ taking five academic classes have roughly 10 hours of school related work each\
    \ day. Of course, this number doesn't include time for other essential tasks like\
    \ getting ready for the day and traveling to and from school. Taking care of an\
    \ infant is time consuming as well. The average infant nurses eight to twelve\
    \ times a day for 20 to 45 minutes. That's over 2 hours spent feeding each day.\
    \ In addition, new mothers report exhaustion from waking up multiple times each\
    \ night, changing, bathing the baby, playing with the child, all take significant\
    \ time as well. With all these activities, most new moms have difficulty concentrating\
    \ and finding time to rest, let alone do their homework. Another challenge we\
    \ have is poverty. Teen mothers suffer from poverty. They resort to transactional\
    \ sex or endure gender violence and abuse in exchange for material goods, food\
    \ or money. Many of these young girls, they are younger than the fathers of their\
    \ babies. Thus a huge power imbalance, making it difficult for poor teenage mothers\
    \ to defend and protect themselves from abusers. Some end up opting for early\
    \ marriages, a way of assessing food, clothing, housing and security, which is\
    \ very sad. Mental health problems I'll have to repeat on this and explain more.\
    \ We have several factors that can negatively affect her teens mother's mental\
    \ health. These include lack of sufficient sleep, lack of family support, especially\
    \ in cases where pregnant teens are kicked out of parents or guardians' home,\
    \ change in social status, loss of friends, the cost of raising a child, and the\
    \ hassle of juggling school or raising a child. This and others can lead to mental\
    \ health problems, including stress and depression. We have the possibility of\
    \ family conflict. Telling your parents that you are pregnant isn't easy at all.\
    \ Many parents are understandably upset when they learn that their child is pregnant.\
    \ In the worst case scenario, parents have kicked their pregnant daughters out\
    \ of the house without any support. We also have change in social status. Teen\
    \ mothers often experienced a vast change in their social lives. Some drop out\
    \ of schools to devote time to raising their children. Others may stay in school\
    \ but must drop extracurricular activities to find a job to support their child's\
    \ needs. All of these courses are disconnected from previous social circles and\
    \ some girls report that friends maintain contact in the beginning, but their\
    \ friendship change as the new mother's focus changes. There are a lot of them,\
    \ but I don't know if time allows us to continue with some. Maybe I can read one\
    \ more whereby they lose opportunity to advance education. Girls lose their childhood\
    \ and are forced to drop the education to adapt to the life of caring for their\
    \ children whereby you see in Kenya, 98% of teen mothers are out of school with\
    \ a zero probability of returning. We have stigma and rejection. Teen mothers\
    \ face stigma from their parents, actually teachers, peers and society. This has\
    \ made it difficult for teen moms to seek social and moral support and at times\
    \ many are disowned by their parents or kicked out of home. This leaves them with\
    \ more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation in their community. So let's show\
    \ them love, support, care as many times as we can. Thank you very much Mister\
    \ Francis.\n12:58:100\n\n12:59:97\n[Speaker 1]: Thank you so much for that. That\
    \ was so informative. At least we have known some of the challenges teen mothers\
    \ face through when they get their kids in early age. Thank you for coming through\
    \ and thank you for having you.\n13:13:98\n\n13:15:99\n[Speaker 2]: I'm so much\
    \ humbled for having your time actually. And let me say thank you once again.\n\

  transcript: '00:00:00

    [Speaker 1]: Alright, so our topic for today is technology.


    00:06:02

    [Speaker 2]: Does it bring people together? Does it bring people closer or does
    it drive them? Apartheid? What''s your take on that?


    00:15:03

    [Speaker 1]: This is a very tricky one because in my opinion, technology bring
    people together and it also drives them apart. But in this instance, I would say
    that it''s bringing people together.


    00:30:02

    [Speaker 2]: I disagree. The majority of the technology, mostly it like drives
    people apart.


    00:42:03

    [Speaker 1]: You think so?


    00:44:03

    [Speaker 2]: Yes.


    00:44:03

    [Speaker 1]: All right, so the main reason that I''m saying that it''s bringing
    people closer.


    00:51:01

    [Speaker 2]: Would be.


    00:54:98

    [Speaker 1]: The source of communication. Right? So we are able to communicate
    with our loved ones, even though they are across borders, they are in other countries,
    they are not close to us, but we are able to get in touch with them. And it''s
    because of technology that is possible, you know? So why would you think that
    it''s driving people apart?


    01:27:02

    [Speaker 2]: It goes both ways, actually.


    01:29:02

    [Speaker 1]: It does.


    01:31:98

    [Speaker 2]: But the majority, I would say, drives people apart because, like,
    there''s a lot of negativity in social media.


    01:39:98

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah, because social media is also a part of technology.


    01:46:02

    [Speaker 2]: It drives people apart because, like, example, if you post something
    and like, people are good in your comment and violate you, say bad things about
    you, bully you. Cyberbullying just because. Yeah, cyberbullying. And it will get
    you like self esteem down.


    02:04:98

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah.


    02:10:00

    [Speaker 2]: And for people, you know, like, like personally, you would like,
    they would like sometimes like expose you for things that shouldn''t be known.
    And most of the times you would like, cut those people off. That''s why it''s
    driving them apart.


    02:33:03

    [Speaker 1]: That''s why. Yeah, you, you have a point there. You know, the other
    day I was actually, I saw this post on Facebook. Right?


    02:43:01

    [Speaker 2]: Yes.


    02:43:01

    [Speaker 1]: So there was this, there was a Snapchat of this lady and a guy. So
    they were holding hands in the mall, you know, but the caption was like, you know
    what? This guy is a married man, so he was actually cheating on his wife. You
    know, so it''s actually a bad impact because, all right. It is a good thing that
    a woman finally knows the wife found out.


    03:16:99

    [Speaker 2]: And knows the truth.


    03:16:99

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah. What her husband was actually up to all this time. But the
    thing is, it''s going to hurt her. She''s going to hurt to.


    03:26:99

    [Speaker 2]: That''s why I say it''s driving them apart.


    03:29:02

    [Speaker 1]: Yes. And in a case of children, social.


    03:31:100

    [Speaker 2]: Media, you know, they will get bullied.


    03:35:01

    [Speaker 1]: You know, when once something is actually there on social media,
    it is there forever. Forever. If you go after 15 years and search for it still
    there, you''re going to find it, you know? But then I heard that if you want to
    take something down on social media or on a website, it cost you a lot of cash.
    Have you heard of them?


    03:55:99

    [Speaker 2]: Even if you do take it down, people who know.


    04:00:98

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah.


    04:00:98

    [Speaker 2]: Will, like, bully you. They still know. That doesn''t mean when it.
    When the video or anything, it''s taken. It''s taken. It''s taken down on the.
    Yeah, social media, it''s not taken down on people''s, like, brains. They remember
    it.


    04:18:98

    [Speaker 1]: Google is actually spying on us. I''m telling you. I''m telling you.
    So I also feel sorry for the kids, you know, to. Because they''re gonna get bullied
    at school and, yeah, it''s driving them apart in some way, you know. So in a case
    of schools, would you say that technology has brought people together or driven
    them apartheid schools premises?


    04:50:01

    [Speaker 2]: I don''t know about that, because, like, in our school, we don''t
    use. Actually, we don''t use phones.


    04:55:02

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah.


    04:55:02

    [Speaker 2]: Yeah. So, yeah, we only use books, but for other, like, schools where
    they use, like, technology, like laptops, it''s. It''s, it''s. It''s a good thing
    because, like, the books are heavy. Books are heavy. So having to carry, like,
    um, just laptop and it has all the textbooks you need to have is actually a good
    thing. It''s a good thing, yeah.


    05:25:98

    [Speaker 1]: All right, so in the ongoing debate about the impact of technology
    on human relationships, the questions arises. You know, this question, this topic
    that we actually talking about, it arises. Lot of time, you know, I''ve been hearing
    it about. I''ve been hearing about it for the longest time. So I also feel that
    it brings us together because I can actually work from home, you know, with my
    laptop, not being there by the office. I can talk to my colleagues and interact
    with them and also with clients, you know, if I need to talk with them regarding
    our work and stuff.


    06:16:03

    [Speaker 2]: And technology is addictive, so it drives people, um, drives people
    away, like, they don''t from themselves mental states and friends, because, like,
    most. Most people would rather, like, go. Go on their phone and scroll on TikTok,
    social media, score anything, and not go with their friends and, like, having,
    like, you know.


    06:41:99

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah. So, like, in this case, we didn''t actually disagree with each
    other that much. We actually agree with each other because it goes both ways,
    you know? So I would say that it has the capacity to both bring people close together
    and create distance, depending on how it is utilized.


    07:06:99

    [Speaker 2]: Utilized.


    07:06:99

    [Speaker 1]: You know, by leveraging digital tools, you know, thoughtfully and
    managing screen time and in person interactions, you know, people can.


    07:22:01

    [Speaker 2]: Benefit from technology, can harness the benefits.


    07:25:01

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah, they can. While preserving the richness of personal connections.
    We actually shouldn''t forget that we actually need each other more than we need
    technology know. But it''s also, it''s, it''s actually always nice to go paperless.
    As you said, books are heavy. And, you know, what I like about computers, or rather
    laptops is that you can create your file, you can create your file and your documents
    and you can file your documents nicely in your, in your folders, in your computer,
    alphabetically. So whenever you need documents. Yes. It''s easier, it''s easier
    to go there.


    08:14:02

    [Speaker 2]: Than carrying loads of weight.


    08:17:02

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah. Yes. So other than that, I feel that we, and, you know, and
    white light.


    08:25:98

    [Speaker 2]: We need lightest technology.


    08:28:01

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah, lightest technology.


    08:30:00

    [Speaker 2]: Light bulbs.


    08:30:00

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah, yeah. To cook, we need technology. Yeah.


    08:34:99

    [Speaker 2]: We need stoves. You know, so it actually has a good, like, it goes
    both sides.


    08:41:00

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah. But when coming to a point of machinery innovation, I feel
    that most people.


    08:52:01

    [Speaker 2]: Loses their job because of their job, because of technology. Yeah,
    yeah. Though, um, technology actually that advances and they make robots so they
    cannot pay like, people.


    09:08:03

    [Speaker 1]: They cannot pay people.


    09:08:03

    [Speaker 2]: And, uh, the robots are actually most efficient and give out better
    results.


    09:15:99

    [Speaker 1]: But it''s not, it''s, yeah, not a.


    09:18:98

    [Speaker 2]: Good thing on, like, for the companies. A good, it''s a good thing
    because, like, they don''t get delayed because of people. Because some people
    can have a limit of, like, physical labor.


    09:31:98

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah.


    09:31:98

    [Speaker 2]: So, like, the world do not get, like, don''t have like, day off day.


    09:38:98

    [Speaker 1]: I do get that it''s an ongoing thing, productivity. But then when
    it, when it comes, yeah, when it comes to maybe do they service robots, those
    robots or whatever, how do they, like, do they maintain them? Maintenance, my
    guy. Like, I feel that they, they do need maintenance because you can''t, you
    can''t, you can''t work every day without maintenance. You know, it''s like a
    car. You need to service your car after a certain time of, period of time. Yes.
    You need to service it. You need to service like, everything. Even your laptop,
    your computer, you, laptop, you, you need to service them. Yeah. So I don''t know.
    But then, you know what? I''ll research about that if robots are actually being
    maintained or what. So in concluding everything, I feel that today''s topic was
    very educative to me. Yeah, it was very educative to me because we actually don''t,
    we actually take things, like, for granted. For granted. But I also feel that,
    you know, what? What do you feel about google?


    10:55:98

    [Speaker 2]: Google? I feel. I feel like it''s a good thing.


    10:58:02

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah.


    10:58:02

    [Speaker 2]: It has this downside. Downside body. But mostly. Mostly it''s a good
    thing because, like, you could just google something if, like, you need something,
    like, work related. Just go to google quick search, get what you want.


    11:14:03

    [Speaker 1]: Or maybe if you''re busy with a.


    11:15:99

    [Speaker 2]: Rather than. Rather than going to a book, reading everything. Yeah.
    Going to libraries, you have Google fast. Yeah.


    11:24:02

    [Speaker 1]: Or maybe when you. Maybe when you''re busy with your book and then
    you come across this road that you really do not understand, so you kind of.


    11:32:98

    [Speaker 2]: It''s just quick to go to Google rather than to fetch a dictionary
    and go search for the word. I feel like a lot of.


    11:46:98

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah. Some people may not feel the same way that we do, but I feel
    that, you know, and there are a lot of things that, you know, we can teach our
    toddlers. There are a lot of videos that we get on phones, social media about,
    you know, learning them side words, learning them, the sounds of. Of every Alphabet
    and stuff, making it creative, you know? So I think that it is a. It is bringing
    people together because, I mean, do you watch cocomelon? Yeah. Because immediately,
    when your toddlers acting upon you, you immediately turn on the cocomelo on your
    smart tv. It''s actually technology. And then he or she becomes pleasant, happy
    with you and stuff. So it brought you together, and they become smart.


    12:52:02

    [Speaker 2]: Those shows, like, give. Give out education.


    12:57:03

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah. But then I also heard that we should actually choose which
    shows should they watch.


    13:02:01

    [Speaker 2]: Yeah, because there are some. That''s what I''m saying. There are
    some good things. There''s some bad things. There''s some, like, kid things you
    don''t know that, like, um, has a better gender.


    13:14:03

    [Speaker 1]: Yeah.


    13:14:03

    [Speaker 2]: Like, your kids. So your kids are not gonna grow up. Like, how. They''re
    actually gonna actually have to.


    13:21:01

    13:21:01

    [Speaker 2]: But the good side is they know. They. They get to know a lot of things.
    They get to know how to, like, talk to people because, like, they remember. Oh,
    I remember this. I remember this. So, yeah, technology is a. I once saw this.


    13:38:01

    [Speaker 1]: This video on TikTok. This guy was actually trashing Peppa pig. Do
    you know Peppa pig? Yes, peppa pig. He was actually trashing it, saying that we
    shouldn''t let kids watch Peppa Pig because she''s actually rude and she''s so
    controlling, you know? And then one time, I took time to actually watch it because
    my son watches it. He loves it. Yes. So I actually took time to watch it, right?
    So while I was busy watching it, what he said and comparing to what I see to what
    I saw at that moment was actually two different things. You know, I saw pepper
    conducting good manners for his. For her brother George, you know?


    14:37:03

    [Speaker 2]: Now let''s wrap it up. In conclusion, technology has good and bad
    things, so you just gotta drive them.

    \ because they have feelings. Yes. \n00:19:98\n\n00:17:97\n[Speaker 2]: they are\
    \ just like humans\n00:18:98\n\n00:20:97\n[Speaker 1]: They have feelings, they\

    [Speaker 2]: You''re welcome.

    00:01:02


    00:02:01

    [Speaker 1]: On today''s topic, we''ll be discussing about racism. I have several
    questions to ask about it. Mr Liam, could you kindly tell us what is racism?

    00:11:03


    00:12:02

    [Speaker 2]: Racism, to me, is discrimination or  by an individual, community,
    or institution against a person or people on the basis of their membership or
    particular racial or ethnic group.

    00:31:03


    00:33:98

    [Speaker 1]: And while we are still at it, have you ever personally experienced
    or witnessed racism?

    00:39:98


    00:40:03

    [Speaker 2]: Yes, I have two cases where I witnessed or I was a victim of racism.
    Number one, I was reported by my neighbors who thought I was a thief just because
    of my color.

    01:00:100


    01:00:100

    [Speaker 1]: When was and where was this?

    01:02:100


    01:04:01

    [Speaker 2]: This happened in the United States of America. I had gone to stay
    with my cousin. I went there as a student. Yes. Number two, the other case happened
    at school where students used to bully me because of my color, because of my race.
    And it really was a bad incident.

    01:31:01


    01:31:02

    [Speaker 1]: So sorry about that. And how did it make you feel?

    01:36:03


    01:37:100

    [Speaker 2]: I felt that my self esteem had gone down. I was insecure. I was also.
    And I also became antisocial. I was traumatized. Yes.

    01:54:03


    01:55:100

    [Speaker 1]: So, Mr Liam, I''m so sorry to hear about that and the experience
    that you went through. And do you think racism is still an issue in today''s society?

    02:05:00


    02:06:01

    [Speaker 2]: Yes, racism still is an issue in today''s society because it affects
    so many people, and it also causes mostly self esteem and you lose, or it affects
    the abilities of yourself.

    02:28:00


    02:30:00

    [Speaker 1]: And How do you think we can work towards eradicating it?

    02:33:99


    02:35:03

    [Speaker 2]: Racism can be worked to be eradicated in several ways. You can learn
    to recognize and understand your own privileges. By this, you can be checking
    your own privileges and using your privileges to dismantle systematic racism by
    race. You can examine your own biases and consider where they may have originated.
    In that case. I mean, you ask yourself as a kid, what messages did you receive
    about other people who are different from you? You can also validate the experiences
    and feelings of people of color. By that, you can do by supporting the experiences
    and engaging in tough conversation about race and injustices. You can also challenge
    the colorblind ideology. You can also call out racist jokers or correct them and
    educate them. You can find out how your school or your company, which you work
    in, is expanded or has expanded opportunities for people of color.

    04:09:01


    04:10:100

    [Speaker 1]: Thank you very much, Mr Washira, for your time. To make us understand
    more about racism. And I''m really sorry about the experience that you had in
    the US. And hopefully people understand more about racism and those that are in
    the forefront to make sure that people feel insecure the way you felt and antisocial
    the way you felt because of racism, they really stop about it. Thank you once
    again for agreeing to be on board with us.

    04:46:03


    04:47:02

    [Speaker 2]: Thank you so much for inviting me. And thank you so much for sharing
    about racism. One thing I would like to tell people, people should always fight
    racism. It''s not good and it always affects your self esteem. That is the first
    thing racism does.

    05:08:98


    05:10:04

    [Speaker 1]: Thank you.

    05:10:98



    05:11:00

    [Speaker 2]: You''re welcome.
